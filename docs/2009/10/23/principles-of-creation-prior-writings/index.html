<a href="http://citmedia.org/blog/2009/01/22/obama-starts-to-follow-through-on-transparency/">Obama Starts to Follow Through on Transparency</a><br />
This is indeed good news. The Bush administration’s fanatical devotion to secrecy was at least as much about keeping the public from finding out scandalous behavior as protecting information that, if disclosed, might endanger national security. <a href="http://citmedia.org/blog/2009/01/22/obama-starts-to-follow-through-on-transparency/">more&#8230;</a></p>
<p><a href="http://citmedia.org/blog/2009/01/18/newspaper-creates-discusses-database-of-obama-donors-but-hides-full-list/">Newspaper Creates, Discusses Database of Obama Donors, but Hides Full List</a><br />
This is the kind of thing that makes me crazy. The Washington Post runs an interesting story — Obama’s $100,000-Plus Donors Were Able to Give to Several Entities — about “nearly 100? wealthy families who’ve been giving big bucks to Obama. The story is based on data the paper crunched itself. <a href="http://citmedia.org/blog/2009/01/18/newspaper-creates-discusses-database-of-obama-donors-but-hides-full-list/">more&#8230;</a></p>

<blockquote><p>StinkyJournalism.org: The Unspoken Peril for “Citizen Journalists” Surprise! You Owe the IRS Some Gift Tax! Is the “donation” of a citizen’s content (video, articles, commentaries, images) to for-profit media outlets that exceeds a fair market value of $12,000 in any single year subject to gift tax? Judging from the IRS guidelines, the answer is “yes.”<br />

<a href="http://citmedia.org/blog/2008/12/31/clueless-authors-government-censorship-better-than-corporate/">Authors: Government Censorship Better than Corporate</a><br />
LA Observed has a post about how KRON TV in San Francisco disinvited the authors of a new book from a talk-show appearance after discovering that the book, No Time to Think: The Menace of Media Speed and the 24-hour News Cycle, takes shots at the crappy state of local TV news. My initial reaction was incredulity. I mean, how clueless is that kind of move? <a href="http://citmedia.org/blog/2008/12/31/clueless-authors-government-censorship-better-than-corporate/">more&#8230;</a></p>
<p><a href="http://citmedia.org/blog/2008/12/04/ny-times-continues-to-push-old-media-boundaries/">NY Times Continues to Push Old-Media Boundaries</a><br />
Two interesting developments today at the New York Times online:</p>
<p>The first, and most noteworthy, is the paper’s welcome discovery that aggregation of and links to things it didn’t produce in-house improve the audience experience. As the graphic shows, the green-highlighted items below the story summaries are links to coverage in other media — including bloggers and direct competitors. The technology behind this feature comes from Blogrunner, a news aggregator the Times acquired a while back. <a href="http://citmedia.org/blog/2008/12/04/ny-times-continues-to-push-old-media-boundaries/">more&#8230;</a></p>
<p><a href="http://citmedia.org/blog/2008/11/30/unethical-practices-by-ex-general-and-nbc-news/">Unethical Practices by Ex-General and NBC News</a><br />
The New York Times’ David Barstow has an astonishing piece in today’s paper, “One Man’s Military-Industrial-Media Complex,” about former “drug czar” and retired general Barry McCaffrey, one of many retired military people working as supposedly independent analysts for various news organizations but who are anything but independent. <a href="http://citmedia.org/blog/2008/11/30/unethical-practices-by-ex-general-and-nbc-news/">more&#8230;</a></p>
<p><a href="http://citmedia.org/blog/2008/10/08/housing-bubble-journalism-still-inadequate/">Housing Bubble Journalism: Still Inadequate</a><br />
In today’s Wall Street Journal story about the deflation of the housing bubble, “Housing Pain Gauge: Nearly 1 in 6 Owners ‘Under Water’,” consider this passage: <a href="http://citmedia.org/blog/2008/10/08/housing-bubble-journalism-still-inadequate/">more&#8230;</a></p>

<blockquote><p>NY Times: Apple Denies ‘Citizen Journalist Report’. Apple’s stock took a brief roller coaster ride this morning after a CNN “citizen journalist” wrote that an “insider” reported that Steve Jobs had been rushed to the hospital with chest pains.</p></blockquote>
<p>Aha! Those infernal citizen journalists are ruining the world! <a href="http://citmedia.org/blog/2008/10/03/cnns-small-mistake-apple-shareholders-big-one/">more&#8230;</a></p>
<p><a href="http://citmedia.org/blog/2008/09/17/financial-meltdown-journalists-ignored-the-early-and-obvious-signs/">Financial Meltdown: Journalists Ignored the Early and Obvious Signs</a><br />
If our economy goes off a cliff, journalists won’t be the ones at fault. But they’ll have much to answer for anyway, because they utterly failed to do their jobs when it counted. <a href="http://citmedia.org/blog/2008/09/17/financial-meltdown-journalists-ignored-the-early-and-obvious-signs/">more&#8230;</a></p>
<p><a href="http://citmedia.org/blog/2008/09/10/double-standard-in-olbermann-matthews-downgrading/">Double Standard in Olbermann-Matthews Downgrading</a><br />
NBC has every right to take Keith Olbermann and Chris Matthews out of their anchor chairs for political events. But there’s a bizarre double standard at work in much of the traditional media commentary on this. <a href="http://citmedia.org/blog/2008/09/10/double-standard-in-olbermann-matthews-downgrading/">more&#8230;</a></p>
<p><a href="http://citmedia.org/blog/2008/08/07/abc-news-responds-on-anthrax-sort-of/">ABC News Responds on Anthrax, Sort Of</a><br />
Props to TVNewser’s Steven Krakauer, who has an interview with Brian Ross of ABC News. Ross is the journalist who in 2001 fueled our national fears with his reporting on the anthrax killings, citing unnamed sources who falsely linked the anthrax attacks to Saddam Hussein and Iraq. In light of recent (and still somewhat murky) revelations in recent days, Jay Rosen and I asked three questions we hoped ABC would address. (Here’s my version; here’s Jay’s.) <a href="http://citmedia.org/blog/2008/08/07/abc-news-responds-on-anthrax-sort-of/">more&#8230;</a></p>
<p><a href="http://citmedia.org/blog/2008/08/03/abc-has-major-questions-to-answer-in-anthrax-story/">ABC Has Major Questions to Answer in Anthrax Story</a><br />
ABC News’ behavior surrounding one of its biggest “scoops” is already an object lesson of what’s wrong with American journalism. The news organization has proved unwilling — so far, at any rate — to come clean about how it was manipulated in the 2001 (and later) investigation into the anthrax attacks in the US following September 11. <a href="http://citmedia.org/blog/2008/08/03/abc-has-major-questions-to-answer-in-anthrax-story/">more&#8230;</a></p>
<p><a href="http://citmedia.org/blog/2008/07/23/helping-the-almost-journalists-do-journalism/">Helping the Almost-Journalists Do Journalism</a><br />
Doing journalism at its most basic level is a combination of two essential tasks. The first is reporting — gathering information via research, interviews, etc. The second part is telling your audience what you’ve learned — writing (in the broadest sense, including video, audio, graphics and more) and editing. <a href="http://citmedia.org/blog/2008/07/23/helping-the-almost-journalists-do-journalism/">more&#8230;</a></p>
<p><a href="http://citmedia.org/blog/2008/04/20/sock-puppets-for-the-bush-administration/">Sock Puppets for the Bush Administration</a><br />
It is, of course, a scandal. What’s worse is the non-response of the media companies that have been suckers for this propaganda. Stonewalling is what we should expect from the government, not supposedly responsible news organizations. <a href="http://citmedia.org/blog/2008/04/20/sock-puppets-for-the-bush-administration/">more&#8230;</a></p>

In a brief but illuminating email thread leading up to a small conference on Friday in LA, we’re looking at key questions about citizen media’s future. One, obviously, is sustainability, which we all agree is key. <a href="http://citmedia.org/blog/2008/03/26/sustainability-in-citizen-media/">more&#8230;</a></p>

<blockquote><p>AP: Media barred from covering Rove speech at prep school. The media have been barred from covering a speech by former presidential adviser Karl Rove to students at a prestigious prep school on Monday.</p></blockquote>

I could follow anyone reading this with a video camera for an hour and post something on the Web that would make you look ridiculous. You could do the same to me.

<blockquote><p>Lord Black is the author of “Richard M. Nixon: A Life in Full” and “Franklin Delano Roosevelt: Champion of Freedom.”</p></blockquote>
<p>True, I guess, but of course it’s missing the most salient element of the man’s recent biography — his criminal conviction for looting the media company he controlled. <a href="http://citmedia.org/blog/2008/01/17/oh-that-conrad-black/">more&#8230;</a></p>

I want to come full circle on a posting last July, when a London newspaper, commenting on the likely move of a senior News Corp. editor to the Wall Street Journal should — as has happened — Rupert Murdoch’s company buy Dow Jones. <a href="http://citmedia.org/blog/2007/12/09/confirming-a-lie/">more&#8230;</a></p>

<blockquote><p>Dan Bartlett in Texas Monthly: I mean, talk about a direct IV into the vein of your support. It’s a very efficient way to communicate. They regurgitate exactly and put up on their blogs what you said to them. It is something that we’ve cultivated and have really tried to put quite a bit of focus on.</p></blockquote>

Jeff Jarvis ably shreds NY Times editor Bill Keller’s straw men. Sadly, Keller and other major media people are still making this a bloggers against professional journalists question, which is not the question at all, or at least hasn’t been for anyone who actually knows anything about the development of new media. <a href="http://citmedia.org/blog/2007/12/02/again-big-media-guy-tries-to-make-it-bloggers-versus-journalists/">more&#8230;</a></p>

The New York Times, eschewing bogus journalism, takes on the raft of falsehoods Rudy Guiliani has been peddling to sell his presidential candidacy — and does it without the standard he-said, she-said mincing of words. In “Citing Statistics, Giuliani Misses Time and Again,” reporter Michael Cooper cites “facts” that</p>
<blockquote><p>are incomplete, exaggerated or just plain wrong. And while, to be sure, all candidates use misleading statistics from time to time, Mr. Giuliani has made statistics a central part of his candidacy as he campaigns on his record.</p></blockquote>

The furor surrounding Joe Klein’s misguided column of a week ago continues, incredibly, given Klein’s bizarre insistence on digging the hole deeper instead of forthrightly acknowledging error(s) and moving on. But this is not just about a columnist’s mistakes and tone-deafness. This is a debacle for the publication and company that employs him, because Time itself has compounded the problem, demonstrating contempt for its audience. <a href="http://citmedia.org/blog/2007/11/30/on-kleins-errors-time-still-wont-fully-fess-up/">more&#8230;</a></p>

One of the most amazing episodes in modern American journalism has emerged from a flagrantly inaccurate and misguided Time magazine column by Joe Klein. He’s a political writer whose work in this case may become Exhibit A for what’s wrong with the craft today. <a href="http://citmedia.org/blog/2007/11/26/shameful-journalism-by-time-magazines-joe-klein/">more&#8230;</a></p>

Clark Hoyt, the paper’s public editor, notes the NY Times’ continuing publication of pieces by Henry Blodget, one of the Internet bubble’s most notorious characters. In “Taint by Association” Hoyt asks two key questions: <a href="http://citmedia.org/blog/2007/11/11/new-york-times-continuing-dealings-with-sleazy-former-wall-streeter/">more&#8230;</a></p>

My friend Walt Mossberg, the Wall Street Journal’s superb tech columnist, has a plea in today’s paper called “Free My Phone” — asking the government force open what he calls the “Soviet Ministry” model of mobile phone service, a system that treats customers as if they were pawns. <a href="http://citmedia.org/blog/2007/10/22/a-guaranteed-profit-why/">more&#8230;</a></p>

One notable lapse, in addition: When I looked at the Times home page today I didn’t find any reference to Hoyt’s piece. It should have been flagged on the home page, because this is a case where transparency would best be more prominent. A small, unchanging link to the public-editor page is insufficient. <a href="http://citmedia.org/blog/2007/09/23/ny-times-and-moveon-ad-violation-of-policy/">more&#8230;</a></p>

Observe “Trashing Petraeus,” an editorial in today’s Wall Street Journal. It weeps for the loss of civility in political discourse, pointing to a MoveOn.org advertisement in yesterday’s New York Times and congressional Democrats’ silence about it as evidence that “the ability of the U.S. political system to function will be impaired in a way no one would wish for.” <a href="http://citmedia.org/blog/2007/09/11/crocodile-tears-from-wall-street-journal-editorial-page/">more&#8230;</a></p>

Buried in this New York Times story is the following incredible finding from a new poll:</p>
<blockquote><p>Six in 10 Americans said in the poll that administration officials deliberately misled the public in making a case for the war; 33 percent of all Americans, including 40 percent of Republicans and 27 percent of Democrats, say Saddam Hussein was personally involved in the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001.</p></blockquote>

Newspapers and broadcasters were raking in billions in advertising from the real estate and banking industries as this bubble inflated. I do not believe this is a coincidence.

<blockquote><p>Jay Rosen: Karl Rove and the Religion of the Washington Press. Savviness is what journalists admire in others. Savvy is what they themselves dearly wish to be. (And to be unsavvy is far worse than being wrong.) Savviness—that quality of being shrewd, practical, well-informed, perceptive, ironic, “with it,” and unsentimental in all things political—is, in a sense, their professional religion. They make a cult of it. And it was this cult that Karl Rove understood and exploited for political gain.</p></blockquote>
<p>My own impression is that Jay is a little too hard here on the Washington press corps, and in particular on the (yes, relatively few) members who have not fallen prey to insider-ness. <a href="http://citmedia.org/blog/2007/08/14/roves-understanding-of-the-media/">more&#8230;</a></p>

<blockquote><p>Congressional aides and others familiar with the details of the law said that its impact went far beyond the small fixes that administration officials had said were needed to gather information about foreign terrorists. They said seemingly subtle changes in legislative language would sharply alter the legal limits on the government’s ability to monitor millions of phone calls and e-mail messages going in and out of the United States.</p></blockquote>

The New York Times, running an interview with David G. Neeleman, the beleaguered chief executive of airline JetBlue, reports that “JetBlue’s C.E.O. Is ‘Mortified’ After Fliers Are Stranded” in last week’s snowstorms. Neeleman’s words to the Times are indeed abject in their regret, and forceful in his intention to turn around a situation that may have hurt his company badly. <a href="http://citmedia.org/blog/2007/02/19/jetblue-an-opportunity-missed-online/">more&#8230;</a></p>

Individuals deceive. This is life.

<blockquote><p>Frank Rich (NY Times): Enron: Patron Saint of Bush&#8217;s Fake News. That $97 million may yet prove a mere down payment. The Times reported last weekend that the administration told executive-branch agencies simply to ignore a stern directive by the Congressional Government Accountability Office discouraging the use of &#8220;covert propaganda&#8221; like the Karen Ryan &#8220;news reports.&#8221; In other words, the brakes are off, and before long, the government could have a larger budget for fake news than actual television news divisions have for real news. At last weekend&#8217;s Gridiron dinner, Mr. Bush made a joke about how &#8220;most&#8221; of his good press on Social Security came from Armstrong Williams, and the Washington press corps yukked it up. The joke, however, is on them &#8211; and us.</p></blockquote>
