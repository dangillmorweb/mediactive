Tracking Simulus Spending: Hire Some Unemployed Reporters</a><br />
The Obama administration promises it will be accountable in how it spends our (children’s) money in the new stimulus legislation. On the Recovery.Gov site you’ll see, under the heading “Accountability and Transparency,” some strong rhetoric:</p>
<blockquote><p>This is your money. You have a right to know where it’s going and how it’s being spent.<a href="http://citmedia.org/blog/2009/03/02/tracking-simulus-spending-hire-some-unemployed-reporters/">more&#8230;</a></p></blockquote>

The editorial ran in the MediaNews family of newspapers, including the San Jose Mercury News, the Los Angeles Daily News and Long Beach Press Telegram. <a href="http://citmedia.org/blog/2009/02/02/11-papers-run-corporate-ordered-editorial/">more&#8230;</a></p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://citmedia.org/blog/2009/01/30/endowing-newspapers-what-are-we-saving-anyway/"> Endowing Newspapers: What Are We Saving, Anyway?</a><br />
There’s a debate under way in the newspaper/journalism corner of the blogosphere and Twittersphere, spurred by an op-ed commentary in the New York Times earlier this week. The piece, by Yale’s chief investment officer, David Swensen, and his colleague Michael Schmidt, a Yale financial analyst, starts with a questionable idea — that newspapers should be endowed as nonprofits in order to save them — and goes south from there. <a href="http://citmedia.org/blog/2009/01/30/endowing-newspapers-what-are-we-saving-anyway/">more&#8230;</a></p>

Here’s a piece I wrote for Talking Points Memo on a subject I’ve covered here before. It begins:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our government’s current operating principle seems to be bailing out people who were culpable in the financial meltdown. If so, journalists are surely entitled to billions of dollars. <a href="http://citmedia.org/blog/2009/01/23/traditional-journalisms-failure-in-financial-crisis/">more&#8230;</a></p></blockquote>

The Knight Ridder, now McClatchy, Washington Bureau was a singular hero among journalists who value great reporting and honor back during the run-up to the Iraq war and its disastrous prosecution. I was, and remain, honored to have been employed by the same company during that period when so many other journalists abandoned their duties. <a href="http://citmedia.org/blog/2008/05/30/mcclatchy-defends-its-honor-and-truth/">more&#8230;</a></p>

That’s former White House Press Secretary Scott McClellan’s description of Big Journalism during the Bush administration, especially during the run-up to the Iraq war. With all too few exceptions, it is true — and indelibly stains a craft from which we expect so much more. <a href="http://citmedia.org/blog/2008/05/29/deferential-complicit-enablers/">more&#8230;</a></p>

Looking through the finalists for the 2008 Gerald Loeb Award, several things stand out. Despite the excellence of the work being cited, the list of finalists should raise a note of caution about at least one key metric for the ability of American business journalists to look at major problems before negative trends turn to economic calamity. <a href="http://citmedia.org/blog/2008/05/14/needed-awards-that-belatedly-recognize-great-journalism/">more&#8230;</a></p>
<p><a href="http://citmedia.org/blog/2008/05/08/newspaper-asks-bloggers-for-help/">Newspaper Asks Bloggers for Help</a><br />
Every newspaper should be a portal to the bloggers, Flickr and YouTube posters and others who are creating media about the towns and neighborhoods in the circulation area. That so few understand this is testament to the industry’s continuing cluelessness. <a href="http://citmedia.org/blog/2008/05/08/newspaper-asks-bloggers-for-help/">more&#8230;</a></p>

A truly extraordinary example of journalistic malfeasance is playing out right now. Attorney General Michael Mukasey told a San Francisco audience last week that the Bush administration was aware in the days before the 9/11 attacks that an Al Qaeda official was making calls from a “safe house in Afghanistan” to U.S. but that our government failed to act on that. <a href="http://citmedia.org/blog/2008/04/03/a-lie-or-terrifying-negligence-why-wont-journalists-demand-an-answer/">more&#8230;</a></p>

As I said in a previous posting, newspapers and broadcasters were raking in billions in advertising from the real estate and banking industries as this bubble inflated. I do not believe this is a coincidence. I also don’t believe it was deliberate malfeasance; but you just don’t see lots of tough coverage in media of the people and companies paying the bills. <a href="http://citmedia.org/blog/2008/03/25/housing-bubble-coverage-defending-the-indefensible/">more&#8230;</a></p>

<blockquote><p>We’ve had experience in the past — the New York City subways come to mind — with businesses that began as conventional, for-profit corporations, and, for one reason or another, were later rendered unprofitable while still being viewed as essential services. It’s time to apply some creative thinking to newspapers and, for that matter, to serious journalism in other media. Then we need to convince Americans that they should pay attention to it — and pay for it.</p></blockquote>

I’m not nostalgic for what many newspapers have become: empty journalistic vessels working mostly for the advertisers and shareholders, only vaguely interested in serving the people of their communities. But when newspapers do their best, they are vital parts of those communities, and we need quality journalism more than ever. <a href="http://citmedia.org/blog/2006/03/13/mcclatchy-buying-most-of-knight-ridder/">more&#8230;</a></p>

<blockquote><p>Tom Evslin: AT&#038;T is Ripping Off American Soldiers. It’s bad enough that they overcharge domestic customers but we have alternatives. The soldiers don’t because, according to The Prepaid Press, AT&#038;T has an EXCLUSIVE contract to put payphones in PXes in Iraq and Afghanistan. But, you ask, can’t the soldiers get cheap calling cards to call the US? No! Because AT&#038;T is using (abusing!) its position as monopoly supplier of payphones to block the 800 numbers necessary to use nonAT&#038;T calling cards. <a href="http://citmedia.org/blog/2006/03/12/citizen-journalists-and-a-greedy-telecom-companys-policy/">more&#8230;</a></p></blockquote>

It has not been reported very well outside Southeast Asia, but Thailand is in political upheaval with protests over Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra’s sale of Shin Corporation to Singapore’s government investment arm, Temasek Holdings, under dubious terms. People have taken to the streets in protests over the past few weeks calling for his resignation, with some notable citizen journalism efforts applying the pressure. <a href="http://citmedia.org/blog/2006/02/27/thai-style-citizen-journalism/">more&#8230;</a></p>
<p><a href="http://citmedia.org/blog/2006/02/23/sports-associations-attempt-to-control-the-news/">Sports Association&#8217;s Attempt to Control the News</a><br />
News organizations are beginning to fight back against the absurd and arrogant demands of sports leagues and entertainment conglomerates (often the same entities, in my view). As the Honolulu Star Bulletin notes today, it’s not publishing pictures from the pro golfing tournament being held in its backyard. <a href="http://citmedia.org/blog/2006/02/23/sports-associations-attempt-to-control-the-news/">more&#8230;</a></p>

The San Jose Mercury News’ recent series, “Tainted Trials, Stolen Justice,” is a brilliant and powerful demonstration of what Big Media do at the very finest. Rick Tulsky and his colleagues at the Mercury News should be enormously proud of their accomplishment. It should lead to some serious reforms in a criminal justice system that can go so wrong, sometimes ruining the lives of innocent people in a single-minded pursuit of convictions — at the cost of true justice. <a href="http://citmedia.org/blog/2006/02/01/why-we-still-need-big-media/">more&#8230;</a></p>

What the newspaper has done here is an example of excellent consumer reporting &#8212; a piece that took serious resources, as in money and a willingness to take what undoubtedly will be some serious heat from the markets named here, to accomplish. It&#8217;s difficult to imagine how citizen-journalists could pull off the same story in such a credible way. <a href="http://dangillmor.typepad.com/dan_gillmor_on_grassroots/2005/04/a_story_that_ta.html">more&#8230;</a></p>

<p>It&#8217;s not just labor that finds Wal-Mart such a drain on this nation, and it&#8217;s not just retail rivals. It&#8217;s Wal-Mart&#8217;s way of doing business, which has its positive side but in the end harms this nation far more than it helps. <a href="http://dangillmor.typepad.com/dan_gillmor_on_grassroots/2005/04/countering_walm.html">more&#8230;</a></p>

A journalist called me up today to talk about the Eason Jordan situation, which culminated in Jordan&#8217;s resignation from CNN on Friday.

The &#8220;Jeff Gannon&#8221; saga took an ugly turn. Gannon, you may recall, was the White House &#8220;reporter&#8221; of questionable bona fides &#8212; apparently a Republican operative whose main role was to ask friendly questions of the president and his spokespeople, a countervailing force to what the Bush administration plainly believes is an overwhelmingly liberal White House press corps. (That view of the suck-up brigade is laughable, in my view, given the half-baked, credulous coverage the administration has enjoyed.) <a href="http://dangillmor.typepad.com/dan_gillmor_on_grassroots/2005/02/reporter_gannon.html">more&#8230;</a></p>
