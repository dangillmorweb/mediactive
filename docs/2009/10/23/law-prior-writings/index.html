One of the most intriguing current media legal cases pits GateHouse Media, which owns a pile of newspapers in New England (and elsewhere) against the New York Times Co., owner of the Boston Globe and Boston.com. (UPDATE: A Judge has denied, for now, an injunction.) I’ve been looking at this from both sides’ perspectives, and this is not as simple as it looks on first glance. <a href="http://citmedia.org/blog/2008/12/23/gatehouse-v-ny-times-co-not-so-simple-after-all/">more&#8230;</a></p>

Ask yourself: If the media had done their jobs, would there have been such widespread shock at discovering the mess we’re in? This answers itself. The answer is a loud No. It should inspire shame, not bragging. <a href="http://citmedia.org/blog/2008/09/30/big-media-still-missing-the-point-on-their-culpability-in-financial-debacle/">more&#8230;</a></p>

What does a Swiss bank that does business in the Cayman Islands have in common with a Hong Kong actor who jets around the globe?

Glenn Greenwald accurately explains the grotesque result of laws that seek to curb that amorphous problem of “hate speech” — a concept that turns free speech on its head. And unlike many of his colleagues on the political left, Greenwald explains why he’s defending people whose speech frequently deserves contempt: <a href="http://citmedia.org/blog/2008/01/14/ban-hate-speech-at-your-own-peril/">more&#8230;</a></p>

<blockquote><p>Arizona Republic: Sheriff’s deputies arrest ‘New Times’ owners. The charges stem from a story published under their byline in the Thursday edition of New Times, in which they describe a subpoena the paper reportedly received from a grand jury convened by the Maricopa County Attorney’s Office. Lacey has been released from jail after posting bail; there’s no jail record available on the status of Larkin. Efforts to reach them Friday have been unsuccessful. Grand jury proceedings are secret, and the two wondered in the opening paragraphs of the article whether they could face legal repercussions for making the subpoena public, but they viewed the subpoena as an attack on freedom of the press. <a href="http://citmedia.org/blog/2007/10/20/an-attack-on-free-press/">more&#8230;</a></p></blockquote>

Harvard Crimson: Coop Discourages Notetaking in Bookstore:</p>
<blockquote><p>Coop President Jerry P. Murphy ’73 said that while there is no Coop policy against individual students copying down book information, “we discourage people who are taking down a lot of notes.” The apparent new policy could be a response to efforts by Crimsonreading.org—an online database that allows students to find the books they need for each course at discounted prices from several online booksellers—from writing down the ISBN identification numbers for books at the Coop and then using that information for their Web site. Murphy said the Coop considers that information the Coop’s intellectual property. Crimson Reading disagrees. “We don’t think the Coop owns copyright on this information that should be available to students,” said Tom D. Hadfield ’08, a co-creator of the site. <a href="http://citmedia.org/blog/2007/09/19/claiming-prices-as-intellectual-property/">more&#8230;</a></p></blockquote>

New Zealand’s Parliament has voted itself far-reaching powers to control satire and ridicule of MPs in Parliament, attracting a storm of media and academic criticism.

A bunch of bloggers joined an amicus brief in the Apple-versus-bloggers situation, which asks the court to adopt &#8220;a functional test for the newsgatherers&#8217; privilege that does not discriminate between reporters, regardless of the medium in which they publish&#8221; as well as creating a &#8220;a test that will not impede journalists&#8217; use of the Internet to report news by limiting their constitutional protections when they publish there.&#8221; <a href="http://dangillmor.typepad.com/dan_gillmor_on_grassroots/2005/04/apples_war_on_j.html">more&#8230;<br />

They&#8217;ve been AWOL so far, but finally some Big Media companies are coming to the legal defense (Silicon Valley Watcher) of the Web publishers Apple is suing for reporting &#8220;trade secrets&#8221; in recent months. I suspect this is because the judge in the case dodged the question of whether the site owners were journalists in the first place. <a href="http://dangillmor.typepad.com/dan_gillmor_on_grassroots/2005/04 /pro_journalists.html">more&#8230;</a></p>

Reporting on business, if this bad ruling is upheld on appeal, will be a great deal harder in the future. Companies will simply slap &#8220;trade secret&#8221; protection on everything they do, and any reporter who gets a scoop on anything the company doesn&#8217;t want the public to know about will be under a legal threat.  <a href="http://dangillmor.typepad.com/dan_gillmor_on_grassroots/2005/03/apples_trade_se.html">more&#8230;</a></p>

In an otherwise constructive look at Apple&#8217;s attack on freedom of the press, Business Week Online says:</p>
<blockquote><p>However, blogs have also fast gained a reputation for inaccuracy that threatens to erode their writers&#8217; claim to the title of journalist. Just as these sites have been touted as the new pillars of American democracy for their ability to ensure that any literate person can publish, they have also proven to be swirling rumor mills. In traditional media, the same legal rights that allow a journalist to protect sources also hold such writers accountable to report the truth. If journalists stray from what&#8217;s true, they can be charged with libel.<a href="http://dangillmor.typepad.com/dan_gillmor_on_grassroots/2005/03/note_to_busines.html">more&#8230;</a></p></blockquote>

Apple Computer&#8217;s disgusting attack on three online journalism sites, in a witch hunt to find out who (if anyone) inside the company leaked information about allegedly upcoming products, has taken a nasty turn. Too bad it&#8217;s not surprising &#8212; and journalists of all kinds should be paying attention. <a href="http://dangillmor.typepad.com/dan_gillmor_on_grassroots/2005/03/the_gathering_s.html">more&#8230;</a></p>

Denseness in the copyright sphere is too common a phenomenon, but it&#8217;s bizarre and not a little scary when the offender is a newspaper. After all, newspapers rely in part on the notion of &#8220;fair use&#8221; &#8212; using short quotes from others&#8217; work &#8212; to create their daily report. <a href="http://dangillmor.typepad.com/dan_gillmor_on_grassroots/2005/02/newspaper_objec.html">more&#8230;</a></p>

Apple on Tuesday sued the publisher of Mac enthusiast site Think Secret and other unnamed individuals, alleging that recent postings on the site contain Apple trade secrets, according to court documents seen by CNET News.com. The suit, filed Tuesday in the Superior Court of Santa Clara County, Calif., aims to identify who is leaking the information and to get an injunction preventing further release of trade secrets. However, in filing the suit, Apple identifies specific articles that contain trade secrets, indicating that at least parts of those reports are on the mark. <a href="http://dangillmor.typepad.com/dan_gillmor_on_grassroots/2005/01/arrogance_at_ap.html">more&#8230;</a></p></blockquote>
