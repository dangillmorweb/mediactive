Good news: EveryBlock, the terrific local data site started by Adrian Holovaty, is launching a partnership with the New York Times. <a href="http://citmedia.org/blog/2009/01/28/everyblock-partners-with-new-york-times/">more&#8230;</a></p>
<p><strong>2008</strong><br />
<a href="http://citmedia.org/blog/2008/11/10/spotus-launches/">Spot.us Launches</a><br />
Spot.us home pageDavid Cohn, one of the bright lights among new journalists, has launched Spot.us, a site that aims to persuade people from communities to send money to support excellent journalism about specific issues. I’m an advisor to this project and believe strongly that he’s onto something important. <a href="http://citmedia.org/blog/2008/11/10/spotus-launches/">more&#8230;</a></p>
<p><a href="http://citmedia.org/blog/2008/10/02/skype-cannot-be-trusted-period/">Skype Cannot be Trusted, Period</a><br />
As Salon notes in “Skype sells out to China“, the eBay-owned service has collaborated with a Chinese company to enable spying on the allegedly encrypted messages that Skype users send each other to and from, and within, China. This disgusting sellout should surprise no one. <a href="http://citmedia.org/blog/2008/10/02/skype-cannot-be-trusted-period/">more&#8230;</a></p>

Bloggers are not immune from the law, and they need to understand this clearly. Insurance is a pain, but it’s not a frivolous expense. <a href="http://citmedia.org/blog/2008/09/26/blogger-libel-insurance/">more&#8230;</a></p>
<p><a href="http://citmedia.org/blog/2008/07/04/basecamp-for-organizing-projects/">Basecamp for Organizing Projects</a><br />
For the past several years I’ve been involved in a variety of projects ranging from education to startups. All have involved collaboration, and in most cases the people involved were not in a single location. <a href="http://citmedia.org/blog/2008/07/04/basecamp-for-organizing-projects/">more&#8230;</a></p>

<p><a href="http://citmedia.org/blog/2008/03/31/citizen-huffs-potential-big-score/">Citizen Huff&#8217;s Potential Big Score</a></p>
<blockquote><p>New York Times: Citizen Huff: According to one person who was briefed on discussions but was not permitted to speak for attribution, the company has at least looked at the value of the site if it were put up for sale, and a figure around $200 million was used. That would put the price at more than $50 for each visitor, a high valuation. Using the site’s internal figures, 14 million unique visitors for the most recent month, the price would be closer to $15 for each user. <a href="http://citmedia.org/blog/2008/03/31/citizen-huffs-potential-big-score/">more&#8230;</a></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Jon Garfunkel: Easy Mark: The Elephant in the Locker Room. (I)t’s still immensely foolish as it is to ban someone from the lockerroom because they call themselves a blogger.

Off the Record? Not Unless You Agree Ahead of Time</a><br />
When I was a reporter and then a columnist, I had a rule that no public figure — that is, anyone who’d had experience with being interviewed — had the right to declare anything off the record after the fact. Now I might agree not to publish something if it wasn’t relevant, but if something was to be off the record it would be decided ahead of time. <a href="http://citmedia.org/blog/2008/03/08/off-the-record-not-unless-you-agree-ahead-of-time/">more&#8230;</a></p>

<a href="http://citmedia.org/blog/2007/12/26/utility-in-googles-mobile-maps/">Utility in Google&#8217;s Mobile Maps</a><br />
In Phoenix last week we used Google’s Mobile Maps on the Nokia N95 for a variety of tasks, and found the application to be a huge value. The software looks for the nearest mobile tower (or GPS location if you’ve turned on the GPS function), and when you search for a type of business — we were looking, for example, for a fabric store — you get the nearest ones. <a href="http://citmedia.org/blog/2007/12/26/utility-in-googles-mobile-maps/">more&#8230;</a></p>
<p><a href="http://citmedia.org/blog/2007/12/13/movable-type-goes-open-source/">Movable Type Goes Open Source</a><br />
It’s the smart move: Movable Type is now open source. This will make life a little more complicated for WordPress, but that’s all to the good. <a href="http://citmedia.org/blog/2007/12/13/movable-type-goes-open-source/">more&#8230;</a></p>
<p><a href="http://citmedia.org/blog/2007/11/07/citizen-journalism-tools-in-a-box/">Citizen Journalism Tools in a Box</a><br />
The folks at the Tactical Technology Collective are planning to release soon a “Citizen Journalism Toolkit” that</p>
<blockquote><p>will provide accessible and effective training materials on selected free software tools and web applications with a focus on giving people what they need to know in order to create and distribute content. The materials will cover print publishing, using images, online publishing and audio.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://citmedia.org/blog/2007/10/25/views-of-the-california-fires/">Views of the California Fires</a><br />
It’s astonishing to see what people are doing to help us understand the California fires. Most intriguing are the mashups and postings from all kinds of entities. <a href="http://citmedia.org/blog/2007/10/25/views-of-the-california-fires/">more&#8230;</a></p>
<p><a href="http://citmedia.org/blog/2007/09/29/a-common-traveler-tale-high-cost-net-access/">A Common Traveler Tale: High Cost Net Access</a><br />
My frequent travels expose me to a common problem: high-cost Internet access away from home. This is not a serious issue in the U.S., where I have a T-Mobile hotspot account and find no-extra-charge Wi-Fi connections in many hotels and other venues. <a href="http://citmedia.org/blog/2007/09/29/a-common-traveler-tale-high-cost-net-access/">more&#8230;</a></p>
<p><a href="http://citmedia.org/blog/2007/09/24/making-a-business-of-citizen-media/">Making a Business of Citizen Media</a><br />
Good news: We’re about to launch a first in a series of postings about citizen media as a business.

On Larry King’s program, Dan Rather insisted again that the 60 Minutes story about George W.

<p><a href="http://citmedia.org/blog/2007/09/19/falling-for-the-big-dollar-lawsuit-claim/">Falling for the Big-Dollar Lawsuit Claim</a><br />
When, oh when, will journalists stop falling for the bogus PR stunts lawyers and their clients play when filing lawsuits? Apparently, never. <a href="http://citmedia.org/blog/2007/09/19/falling-for-the-big-dollar-lawsuit-claim/">more&#8230;</a></p>

This device, not yet officially on sale in the U.S., has game-changing potential for journalism. If I ran a newsroom and could talk the money folks into it, I’d hand out E90s to some of my journalists and Web developers. I’d tell them to experiment like crazy, and to watch what other people are doing with these and other powerful mobile systems. I suspect they’d do some amazing things. <a href="http://citmedia.org/blog/2007/09/02/nokia-e90s-enormous-potential-in-journalism/">more&#8230;</a></p>
<p><a href="http://citmedia.org/blog/2007/08/16/is-postal-rate-hike-for-magazines-fair/">Is Postal Rate Hike for Magazines Fair?</a><br />
Free Press, a think tank and lobbying group, posts: “Stamp Out the Rate Hike: What’s at Stake.” This is a fervent call for the public to do what it can to change the terms of a postal rate hike for magazines. <a href="http://citmedia.org/blog/2007/08/16/is-postal-rate-hike-for-magazines-fair/">more&#8230;</a></p>

Based on its description and some reviews, Movable Type 4.0 boasts an astounding number of new features, plus a serious ease-of-use upgrade. <a href="http://citmedia.org/blog/2007/08/15/movable-type-40-launches/">more&#8230;</a></p>

The Silicon Valley company’s general counsel, Mike Dillon, writes that on Monday Sun:</p>

The map at left comes courtesy of the Cato Institute, where Radley Balko has been looking into the increasing number of botched paramilitary-style police raids on private citizens. This presentation starkly shows how common this kind of thing has become — and, as Balko has testified before Congress, this data may only be the tip of the iceberg. <a href="http://citmedia.org/blog/2007/07/06/journalistic-map-mashup-by-think-tank/">more&#8230;</a></p>

This is an important article, in part because it demystifies a process that many folks have found beyond bizarre.

<blockquote><p>puts a newsroom-friendly face on the Google Maps API. The end-user sees an annotated map (or satellite image), with various points of interest marked on it, using custom icons. The points are presented in a sequence, allowing the map’s creator to tell a story in flowing narrative, or simply to encourage continued click-throughs.<a href="http://citmedia.org/blog/2007/06/10/newsmap-stories-that-move-in-space/">more&#8230;</a></p></blockquote>

Paul Krugman of the New York Times nails it today in a column (unfortunately behind the Times’ pay-wall) lambasting the Washington political press corps for its utter blindness at the Republican presidential “debate” a few days ago.

I’ve been in San Diego this week at something called Strong Angel III, a project/demonstration/exercise designed to improve responses to emergencies and catastrophes, both those which are natural and caused by humans. Several hundred smart folks looking at technology and its applications in this kind of situation, and as with the last Strong Angel exercise (which took place two years ago on a lava bed in Hawaii), this one is proving immensely educational. <a href="http://citmedia.org/blog/2006/08/23/strong-angel-lab-for-citizen-media-and-much-more/">more&#8230;</a></p>
