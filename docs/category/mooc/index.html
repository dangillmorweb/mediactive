		<p><em>I&#8217;m asking folks taking our &#8220;MediaLIT: Overcoming Information Overload&#8221; MOOC course to describe their media use for a full day. In this post I&#8217;m combining several posts I did for my regular ASU course, as a demonstration of what I&#8217;m talking about. Note to MOOC folks: WeÂ don&#8217;t expect you to write something this long!</em></p>
<p><strong>As a &#8220;consumer&#8221;:</strong></p>
<p>My daily media consumption is enormous, because I do this for a living. Here&#8217;s what happened one recent day:</p>
<p>When I wake up I briefly check email and <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a>. If something seems super-urgent I may open an email or click through to a link. Usually I don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>At breakfast, using a tablet, I go to the homepages of the <a href="http://nytimes.com">New York Times</a>, <a href="http://wsj.com">Wall Street Journal</a>, <a href="http://washingtonpost.com">Washington Post</a>, and <a href="http://ft.com">Financial Times</a>. All of those outlets have a world view, and I want to see what their editors&#8211;some of the best in journalism&#8211;believe is important. I also check my RSS newsreader, which collects stories and links from a variet of sources I&#8217;ve pre-selected.</p>
<p>At my home-office desk:</p>
<p>&#8212; I check out a number of websites including <a href="http://reddit.com">Reddit</a>, <a href="http://boingboing.net">BoingBoing</a>, <a href="http://arstechnica.com">Ars Technica</a>, <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/">National Review</a>, <a href="http://techdirt.com">TechDirt</a>, <a href="http://www.hbo.com/last-week-tonight-with-john-oliver">Jon Oliver</a> (when HBO posts his regular commentary), among others.</p>
<p>&#8212; I run Twitter and <a href="http://plus.google.com">Google+</a> in separate browser tabs but don&#8217;t try to keep up with it all the time (though I confess I check them more often than I should.) WhetherÂ an important story or some ridiculousÂ meme is bubbling up, I&#8217;ll be likely to notice it among the people I follow. I also check 5 Twitter lists I follow on these topics: journalism, the media business, technology, entrepreneurship and media literacy.</p>
<p>&#8212; Besides regular email, I subscribe to several mail lists on those topics, as well as a great daily list of five items from <a href="http://This.cm">This.cm</a>, a site that creates serendipity for me. I sort those separately in my email inbox, and read them one after the other. Many of the links have already shown up in Twitter, and many point to the traditional and other media sites I routinely scan.</p>
<p>During the day I&#8217;m constantly bouncing around to various media including videos (typically posted on YouTube and Vimeo), audio (NPR and others), and other websites.</p>
<p>After dinner I sometimes watch videos on our television, but almost never live TV. We subscribe to Netflix, Amazon Prime and satellite (Dish). I record some TV series (e.g. &#8220;Justified&#8221;) and watch when I have time, skipping through the commercials.</p>
<p>On my bedside table I have a hardcover book or two (one from the library and one I&#8217;ve bought, the latter almost always written by someone I know), and a Kindle Voyager e-reader. I read for a half hour or so before going to sleep.</p>
<p>Takeaways (similar to what I found when I did this several years ago):</p>
<p>I listen to or watch very little broadcast media apart from NPR (or super-important breaking news, very very rarely).</p>
<p>My main sources of trusted information resemble some of the ones from several decades ago, such as the New York Times (which, like all other media, I do not trust fully, since they do get things wrong from time to time). I get to them in some different ways, however.</p>
<p>In particular, several Twitter lists and Google+ circles (roughly the same thing; collections of people I follow about specific topics) have become filters of great value. I can generally depend on them to send me to information I need to know about. However, I know Iâm missing some important things if I rely only on other people to flag things.</p>
<p>For me, media consumption is an evolving collection of people, sites, conversations, and entertainment. Much of it overlaps. It takes more effort on my part, but I believe Iâm vastly better informed &#8212; and entertained.</p>
<p><strong>As a creator:</strong></p>
<p>I create a lot of media, too, though not nearly as much as I &#8220;consume&#8221; (I hate that word; as I&#8217;ve told students in digital media literacy, we should <i>use</i> media, not consume it).</p>
<p>On a given day, here&#8217;s roughly how I created media. I&#8217;m guessing it&#8217;s different fromÂ what students do these days.Â Most of what I create is text. Not all, but most.</p>
<p>In the morning, I answered a batch of email. I do this regularly during the day, because I get a lot and I try to keep up with it. I&#8217;ll never get to the fabled &#8220;inbox zero&#8221; but I&#8217;ll try. Occasionally IÂ get and send several text messages, most often with my wife.</p>
<p>I post frequently on Twitter, and more occasionally on Google+. (I rarelyÂ use Facebook, for reasons I described in my bookÂ <em>Mediactive.)Â </em></p>
<p>Lately, I&#8217;ve been posting (too infrequently!) to This.cm, a wonderful new service that tries to collect&#8211;from a bunch of interesting users&#8211;just a few items per day that we all believe everyone should see. The site is in beta so I can&#8217;t invite all of you to join it, yet.</p>
<p><a href="http://dangillmor.com/blog">My blog</a> doesn&#8217;t get enough love, though I do post there from time to time. On the day in question I wasted a lot of time responding to someone who was trying to convince me (actually, his own fans) that I&#8217;m wrong about net neutrality.</p>
<p>As a longtime photographer I take lots of pictures. I don&#8217;t post most of them, but when I do it&#8217;s usually to Flickr or Google+ or my blog. I need to do this more. I don&#8217;t have an Instagram account but probably should get one.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a way I semi-create media that most of don&#8217;t appreciate: individualized media via online services. Example: I wanted driving directions the other day, and used Google Maps. It produced a page of directions and a map. This is media, too&#8211;but just for me.</p>
<p>My other media creation, on a regular basis, doesn&#8217;t get seen by anyone but me for some period of time: writing I&#8217;m doing for my columns and essays at <a href="http://www.slate.com/authors.dan_gillmor.html">Slate</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/@dangillmor">Medium</a>, as well as a new book. In a way, those are the most traditionalÂ forms of media I&#8217;ve been making.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s more, but you get the idea!</p>

		<blockquote><p>Weâre in an age of information overload, and too much of what we watch, hear and read is mistaken, deceitful or even dangerous. Yet you and I can take control and make media serve us â all of us â by being active consumers and participants. Hereâs how.</p></blockquote>
<p>Those are the first lines of the video that introduces our upcoming ASU-edX MOOC, called <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/media-lit-overcoming-information-asux-mco425x">&#8220;MediaLIT: Overcoming Information Overload.&#8221;</a> They are the course&#8217;s guideposts.<a href="http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/courselogo.jpg"><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-3611" src="http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/courselogo-150x150.jpg" alt="courselogo" width="150" height="150" /></a></p>
<p>WeÂ knew there would be no shortage of material. In a digital age, we&#8217;re saturated in media, and a lot of it is junk. (Or, to use guest lecturer <a href="http://rheingold.com">Howard Rheingold</a>&#8216;s framing, a lot of information is outrightÂ crap.)</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve done a lot of thinking about how best to present this to a wide audience, beyond the university students who have been studying the topic in my regular class at Arizona State University&#8217;s Walter Cronkite School of Journalism &amp; Mass Communication. One way is to make this asÂ up-to-dateÂ as we possibly can, in the readings and discussions. If you join us for the course, we&#8217;ll be looking at some very current events that illustrate key points.</p>
<p>Another way, and one of (I think) our best decisions early on, isÂ to move thisÂ way beyond the standard lecture-readings-quiz format. How? By asking some experts in the media and media-literacy fields to talk with us&#8211;and people taking the course&#8211;about what they know.</p>
<p>Plenty, as you&#8217;ll see if you sign up.Â Here&#8217;s a taste&#8211;snippets from the videos we&#8217;ll be using in the course&#8211;of their wisdom.Â Such as Wikipedia&#8217;s <a href="http://jimmywales.com/">Jimmy Wales</a>:</p>
<p><iframe width="660" height="495" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IEQF9lEmmzY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>and <a href="http://twitters.com/sulliview">Margaret Sullivan</a>, public editor (ombudsman) at the New York Times:</p>
<p><iframe width="660" height="371" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b2vH7e-IXGs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>and <a href="http://krauss.faculty.asu.edu/">Lawrence Krauss</a>, an ASU colleague who&#8217;s one of America&#8217;s best known scientists:</p>
<p><iframe width="660" height="371" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gjDniBXeb6I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>and <a href="http://blog.amandapalmer.net/">Amanda Palmer</a>, a brilliant musician and Internet innovator:</p>
<p><iframe width="660" height="371" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yXAEEPbw_Ac?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>You get the idea.</p>
<p>These folks are among many who were kind enough to discuss how various kinds of media work (and don&#8217;t); the vital role of journalism in our world; how we as consumers of media need to handle the deluge of information; and much more.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been saying &#8220;we&#8221; a lot in this post. It&#8217;s the only word that fits, because I&#8217;ve been working with an amazing team from <a href="https://www.asu.edu/edplus">ASU Online&#8217;s EdPlus</a> and edX. CNN&#8217;s Brian Stelter (one of our guests) recently told me, speaking of his move from newspapers (the New York Times) to television, that the latter is &#8220;a team sport.&#8221; So, I can assure you, is a MOOC. This wouldn&#8217;t be happening without other people&#8217;s time, talent and effort.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re well aware that the jury is out on whether MOOCs are going to be a major way people learn in the future. Of course they won&#8217;t replace traditional education, I&#8217;m optimistic that they will be at least helpful, if not transformative in some ways. We all see this project as an experiment that we hope will move the genre forward.</p>
<p>Most of all, however, we envisionÂ this MOOC asÂ <em>useful</em>&#8211;for you. While putting it together has beenÂ (shhh) a lot of fun in addition to hard work, the point of it all is to bringÂ media and news literacy to a wider community. That&#8217;s certainly aÂ goal of the <a href="http://Robert R. McCormick Foundation,">Robert R. McCormick Foundation</a>, which has provided funding to help us build and market the course.</p>
<p>I use the word &#8220;community&#8221; deliberately, because I don&#8217;t see the people who sign up for this course solely as students or members of an audience. We want you to be <em>participants</em>, in this project butÂ especially in the use of media in your lives. We hope we&#8217;ll be helpful along the way.</p>

		<p><a href="http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/medialit.png"><img class="alignleft wp-image-3613 size-medium" src="http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/medialit-300x127.png" alt="medialit" width="300" height="127" hspace="2" srcset="http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/medialit-300x127.png 300w, http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/medialit.png 470w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>SomeÂ news: We&#8217;re launchingÂ a MOOC &#8212; a massive open online course &#8212; on news and media literacy. The course (here&#8217;s the <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/media-lit-overcoming-information-asux-mco425x">registration page</a>) will be based on an <a href="https://webapp4.asu.edu/catalog/course?s=MCO&amp;n=%20425">online course</a> I currently teach at Arizona State University&#8217;sÂ <a href="http://cronkite.asu.edu">Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication</a>, and will be open to all who are interested, at no charge.</p>
<p>TheÂ Â MOOC, which has received funding from theÂ <a href="http://www.mccormickfoundation.org/">Robert R. McCormick Foundation</a>,Â will be hosted at <a href="http://edx.org">edX</a>, one of the major&#8211;and rapidly growing&#8211;course platforms. ASU has become a member of the edX university consortium, and this is the first offering from the school. The courseÂ launches July 6, and registration is open now.</p>
<p>(Note: The media-literacy MOOC is not part of the ASU/edX <a href="https://asunews.asu.edu/20150422-asu-edx-online-course-partnership">Global Freshman Academy</a>, which will be offering a battery of for-credit courses.)</p>
<p>We&#8217;re well aware that the <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/technology-and-learning/playing-role-mooc-skeptic-7-concerns">jury is out</a>, to put it mildly, on the ultimate value ofÂ MOOCs. Clearly they&#8217;ve been oversold in some ways. To think that <a href="http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/courselogo.jpg"><img class="alignright wp-image-3611 size-medium" src="http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/courselogo-300x179.jpg" alt="courselogo" width="300" height="179" hspace="2" vspace="2" srcset="http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/courselogo-300x179.jpg 300w, http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/courselogo.jpg 378w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>they&#8217;ll take over education is absurd. Equally clearly, they have enormous potential. This course is experimental by definition, but we have twoÂ major goals: to make it a super-<em>useful</em> learning experience, and to learn from what happens in order to improve the next time.</p>
<p>One of the best parts of this project is the people involved. In the past several months we&#8217;veÂ recorded conversations with some of the smartest folksÂ I know in the newsÂ and media-literacy communities. They include Wikipedia&#8217;s Jimmy Wales; <em>New York Times</em> Public Editor Margaret Sullivan; CNN&#8217;s Brian Stelter; media-literacy guru Renee Hobbs; and many others. We&#8217;ll be featuring these conversations in the course.</p>
<p>This is a team effort in every possible way. I&#8217;m incredibly fortunate to be working with the ASU Online folks, who&#8217;ve been helping me sweat the details and who know lots of things I don&#8217;t. AÂ team of students at the Cronkite School&#8217;s <a href="http://prlab.jmc.asu.edu/">Public Relations Lab</a> has put together some great marketing ideas. PhD candidate Kristy Roschke, whose focusÂ isÂ media literacy, is playing a key role in the course development and will be the lead teaching assistant when the course goes live.</p>
<p>MOOCs are open in ways that most university courses are not. OpennessÂ is core to my work&#8211;such as the <i>Mediactive</i>Â book, on which the course is largelyÂ based, is <a href="http://mediactive.com/book/table-of-contents-2/">free to read online and/or download</a>Â from this site, and is available under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org">Creative Commons</a> copyright license (&#8220;Some Rights Reserved&#8221;). I want to apply theÂ principle of openness, as much as possible, to the new project. So I&#8217;ll be blogging regularly about how we&#8217;re doing this between now and the July 6 launch.</p>
<p>You may find this interesting to watch. If so, and if you think we can improve on what we&#8217;re doing, <a href="http://dangillmor.com/contact/">let me know</a>. I&#8217;m looking for the best ideas, not just my own.</p>
