	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>UPDATED</p>
<p>More than 14 months after running <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/10/09/AR2009100903860.html">an editorial</a> with an egregious factual error, the Washington Post has yet to correct or explain its mistake.</p>
<p>Recapping from an earlier item here: The Post suggested that the Nobel Peace Prize that went to President Obama should have been awarded instead to Neda Agha-Soltan, an Iranian woman who was shot and killed during the post-election protests earlier in Iran this year.</p>
<p>The Post failed to do its homework, as the Atlantic&#8217;s James Fallows noted in detail (<a href="http://jamesfallows.theatlantic.com/archives/2009/10/dont_these_people_have_the_goo.php">here</a>, <a href="http://jamesfallows.theatlantic.com/archives/2009/10/the_speech_obama_wont.php">here</a>). The Nobel Peace Prize rules are clear: The only time it can be awarded after death is when the honoree had already been named &#8220;but who had died before he/she could receive the Prize on December 10.&#8221;</p>
<p>An editorial page concerned with accuracy would correct such a mistake. The Post, despite knowing about this, has not. Draw your own conclusion.</p>
<p>UPDATE: Still uncorrected as of February 9, 2011.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>From yesterday&#8217;s Washington Post <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/discussion/2009/10/07/DI2009100703106.html?hpid=discussions">online chat</a> featuring media critic Howard Kurtz:</p>
<blockquote><p><em><strong>Fairfax County, Va.</strong>: Hi Howard, This Sunday, I read the editorials in The Post and The New York Times about the surprise Peace Prize. I liked the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/10/opinion/10sat1.html">NYT editorial</a> (which was pro), but like most of us, including Obama, I could certainly have handled an editorial that was anti this choice.</em></p>
<p><em>When I read The <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/10/09/AR2009100903860.html">Washington Post editorial</a>, I felt so sad for what this paper has become. Their whole idea was that the prize should have gone to Neda, the woman who was murdered by the Iranian police. Nobel Peace Prizes can&#8217;t be given posthumously. It&#8217;s a basic, easy factcheck. There are other fact problems, too (the protests hadn&#8217;t happened by the nomination date, Neda may not have been a protester).</em></p>
<p><em>So the idea that the committee made a careless or inappropriate choice is refuted by a slapdash editorial &#8220;choice&#8221; that nobody bothered to check? It just screamed out to me &#8220;we laid off almost all the copy editors.&#8221; I feel so sad for The Post I grew up with. It&#8217;s great to have an opinion. It&#8217;s bad to look dumb.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Howard Kurtz</strong>: I take your point about no posthumous awards, though by that standard Martin Luther King couldn&#8217;t have won after being assassinated (yes, I know he won the prize earlier). My reading of the piece was that Neda was being used more as a symbol (though the rule should have been mentioned). But it&#8217;s an editorial. It is by definition opinion. Of course some readers are going to disagree.<br />
</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Unpack Kurtz&#8217;s reply and your jaw will drop. He acknowledges the reader&#8217;s point but then and amplifies his newspaper&#8217;s negligence.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t a trivial point. As the Atlantic&#8217;s James Fallows has noted in painful detail (<a href="http://jamesfallows.theatlantic.com/archives/2009/10/dont_these_people_have_the_goo.php">here</a>, <a href="http://jamesfallows.theatlantic.com/archives/2009/10/the_speech_obama_wont.php">here</a>), the Post editorial page made a rookie error. The Nobel Peace Prize rules are clear: The only time it can be awarded after death is when the honoree had already been named &#8220;but who had died before he/she could receive the Prize on December 10.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Jim Fallows noted, allowing posthumous awards could spark &#8220;a debate every year on whether Abraham Lincoln, St. Francis of Assisi, or Gandhi was the most deserving choice.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kurtz, coming to his colleagues&#8217; defense in a way that utterly dismisses the reader&#8217;s serious chiding of a paper he or she has long cared about, says Neda was a symbol, but that the rule &#8220;should have been mentioned&#8221; in the editorial. Come on. Had the Post editorial writer or his/her editors known of the rule, they would never have run that piece in the first place without a different spin.</p>
<p>The media critic runs totally off the rails when he says the editorial page gets a pass in any case. &#8220;It is by definition opinion,&#8221; he said, as if opinion journalists have less obligation to being factual than other journalists.</p>
<p>I infer from the still-uncorrected editorial (at least on the Post website) that the editorial page editors believe the same thing. In their world, and Kurtz&#8217;s, writing opinions means you have license to make it up as long as it has a certain <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truthiness">truthiness</a>.</p>
<p>Then again, this is the same media critic, after all, who had a glaring error in an online column last month that the paper didn&#8217;t budge on for several days despite having known about the mistake early on. When the paper did address it, the error was replaced with words that were only <a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/ombudsman-blog/2009/09/post_misdemeanors.html">partially correct</a>, and that half-truth remains intact almost a month later.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>UPDATED</p>
<blockquote><p>Arizona Republic (10/09/2009): <a href="http://www.azcentral.com/business/news/articles/2009/10/09/20091009BIZ-psychiceconomy1008.html">More turning to psychics for economic advice</a>. <em>When the going gets tough, Valley residents apparently go in search of the metaphysical. Local psychics and astrologers say that while they&#8217;re seeing some decline in business as longtime clients cut back on discretionary spending, the recession is bringing them many new customers.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Even though it&#8217;s shrinking along with all metropolitan newspapers in America, the Arizona Republic remains by far the biggest news organization in Phoenix and the state of Arizona. It still helps set the agenda for public discourse, and claims to be a responsible operation.</p>
<p>The story quoted above, which ran on the front of its local/state section, demonstrates serious irresponsibility on the part of the newspaper. It&#8217;s a textbook example of why smart readers are tuning out the press.</p>
<p>Consider the way the story starts. The word &#8220;apparently&#8221; is a tip-off that the piece is based on no actual data. Who&#8217;s the source for this alleged mini-flood of new customers? Why, the people selling the product. Makes sense to me: In I-can-see-into-the-future territory, we can just take their word for it.</p>
<p>Not a single customer is quoted. We hear only from the people who are claiming to be getting this influx of new customers. Can&#8217;t the newspaper find even one client?</p>
<p>Look. Newspapers run astrology columns &#8212; something I&#8217;d ban if I ran a paper, because I&#8217;m old-fashioned &#8212; with no disclaimers that there is no scientific basis for what these planet- and star-gazers tell us. But the astrology columns run, typically, near the comics, which is the fiction section of the daily paper.</p>
<p>No newspaper, as far as I know, gives its pages over to self-described psychics. Yet the Republic&#8217;s story quotes several, along with the astrologers, with a straight face.</p>
<p>It even provides a helpful sidebar explaining the difference between psychics, astrologers, fortune-tellers and mediums (in each case with the same level of &#8220;here&#8217;s what they say, never mind what science says&#8221; logic). For example, we learn that a psychic is &#8220;sensitive to non-physical or supernatural forces and influences, able to see into the future and into the events in a person&#8217;s life. Often uses tools such as tarot cards, crystals or tea leaves.&#8221; Gosh, thanks the the deeper insight.</p>
<p>I have to note that journalists spent much of the last decade quoting with a straight face the people from the financial and real estate industries who sold inflated goods to suckers, pulling big fees from the transactions. (Note: I do not indict the entire industry. I have a financial advisor who works for one of the big banks, an old and close friend who&#8217;s never, ever steered me toward something that was aimed at enriching him, and someone who&#8217;s comfortable with my tendency to buy and hold.)</p>
<p>The peddlers got rich, and then disclaimed culpability for the bubble or the financial catastrophe it spawned for those average folks (many of whom, we should noted, played the markets like insane gamblers who lose their kids&#8217; college money at Las Vegas casinos). Maybe a responsible story would have contrasted the slimy advice from the past with the advice people now seek &#8212; foolishly, in my view &#8212; from the self-professed seers.</p>
<p>Had this story appeared on April 1, I&#8217;d have applauded the piece as droll satire. Running with scarcely a hint of reality, it only satirizes the condition of the newspaper industry, or at least this corner of the trade.</p>
<p><em>(Note: The updates to this include some or all of the 3rd, 4th 7th and 8th paragraphs. Also please understand that the post update will make some of the earlier comments feel out of place. This is my doing, not the commenters&#8217;. Anyone who commented early on and wants the comment removed, please <a href="mailto:dan@gillmor.com?subject=astrology comments">email me</a>.)</em></p>

<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-608" style="border: 0pt none; margin: 3px;" title="twitter logo" src="http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/twitter-logo.png" alt="twitter logo" width="138" height="42" />The newspaper has been <a href="http://news.google.com/news/story?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=washington+post+twitter&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;ncl=dgW0mmPfkn7DPoM&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=KVvDSr_rBYr0sgOBjIzIAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=news_result&amp;ct=more-results&amp;resnum=4">ridiculed more than praised</a>. My contribution to the early debate was a <a href="http://twitter.com/dangillmor/status/4401862016">Tweet</a> saying that I considered the move to be more proof &#8212; as if anyone needed it &#8212; that old-line print-journalism people have taken firm control of the Post&#8217;s news operation.</p>
<p>The paper&#8217;s ombudsman, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/linkset/2005/03/25/LI2005032500838.html">Andrew Alexander</a>, called yesterday. He&#8217;s looking into the situation, and wanted to chat further. I agreed that this deserves more than 140-character microblog posts. Here&#8217;s what I sent him this morning by email (expanded somewhat for even more nuance and to generalize beyond solely the Post&#8217;s interests):</p>
<p>From my perspective, this is a case of wanting to do the right thing in principle &#8212; assuring readers that the journalism they read is being done with the highest attention to honorable practices &#8212; but then getting it wrong in practice. While this isn&#8217;t a binary, yes/no question, it&#8217;s a also case where the principle collides with reality and, in my view, more compelling principles.</p>
<p>There are two issues, one immediate and practical and the other larger and more important, but also murkier.</p>
<p>The immediate one is to what extent the Post, or any other news organization that wants to be relevant in the Digital Age, should participate in social media. The Post seems to have taken the most restrictive possible position. As noted, I think that&#8217;s a mistake in a variety of ways.</p>
<p>The large<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rosedavies/110850792/"><img class="alignleft" style="border: 0pt none; margin: 3px;" src="http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/monkeys.jpg" border="0" alt="monkeys.jpg" width="192" height="111" align="left" /></a>r issue is transparency. I&#8217;ll come back to that, but it comes down to something that may sound counter-intuitive: So long as you do excellent journalism, greater transparency will lead readers to believe you less &#8212; that is, they&#8217;ll understand better why it&#8217;s impossible to get everything right all the time &#8212; but they&#8217;ll trust you more.</p>
<p>Others have done a much better job than I&#8217;ll attempt in deconstructing the memo that went out to the staff; Stowe Boyd&#8217;s <a href="http://www.stoweboyd.com/message/2009/09/shut-up.html">line-by-line analysis</a>, while more harsh than I&#8217;d have done, makes the essential points.</p>
<p>The editors&#8217; priestly-vows tone was only one reason some folks ridiculed it, however. So was what lots of us perceived as an unrealistic and ultimately damaging attempt to wall off journalists from participation in real life as a consequence of their work.</p>
<p>Any news organization contemplating such rules has to ask itself, and be prepared to answer, how far up the food chain the rules will travel. In the Post&#8217;s case, does this edict apply to Katharine Weymouth, CEO of Washington Post Media and publisher of the paper? To Don Graham, CEO of the parent company? To the advertising salespeople? To Andy Alexander?</p>
<p>The Post&#8217;s frown on social interaction has ramifications from the purely practical standpoint that social networks are central to tomorrow&#8217;s journalism. Journalism organizations have absolutely no alternative but to participate, in particular in the Post&#8217;s case because it&#8217;s as much a local newspaper, where conversation is core to the future, as a trade journal for the political class (the latter also has plenty of social networking potential).</p>
<p>The new policy misses that, but the paper still pretends to participate in social networks via semi-official accounts on Facebook, Twitter, et al. But social networks are about being social, and human voice is at the heart of online social interaction. Twitter posts from corporate entities are PR. They have no voice. Strip out voice, and there&#8217;s not much point in joining that conversation.</p>
<p>If the Post bosses are really serious about this, by the way, they&#8217;ll need to take it further. Consider this from the memo</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Post journalists must refrain from writing, tweeting or posting anything—including photographs or video—that could be perceived as reflecting political, racial, sexist, religious or other bias or favoritism that could be used to tarnish our journalistic credibility. This same caution should be used when joining, following or friending any person or organization online.<br />
</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Never mind the truly weird equating of racism with religious or political beliefs. I wouldn&#8217;t employ anyone who expressed racist views in any capacity, period.</p>
<p>The bigger problem with the policy, as quoted above, is that it only covers online social networks. It <em>doesn&#8217;t</em> cover the social network we all have in real life, namely our &#8220;analog&#8221; contacts with others.</p>
<p>New shut-up orders will surely have to be extended to social interactions at parties, won&#8217;t they? Given the increasing (and somewhat disturbing) possibility or even likelihood that someone may be collecting audio or video of what people in public life say or do in public, and given the fact that journalists are players in this public arena, isn&#8217;t it now necessary to prohibit journalists from expressing opinions in any setting except, perhaps, at work? (Ask Time magazine&#8217;s <a href="http://www.salon.com/opinion/greenwald/2009/09/01/klein/">Joe Klein</a> about this.)</p>
<p>If the Post extends the edict to offline encounters, at logically may have to, the rights of the employees start to sound like the ones at the CIA, which unlike the Post is not an organization that helps the people you serve have a vital conversation about public policy. But it&#8217;s inevitably where the paper will have to go if this policy sticks.</p>
<p>Which brings me back to the more important issue of transparency. I&#8217;m convinced that it will become one of journalism&#8217;s core principles in this new era, right up there with thoroughness, accuracy, fairness and independent thinking. It has to become part of the process, because without it people will have even less reason to trust what journalists do. It will be forced on some organizations that resist; the Post seems likely to be in that camp of resisters, at least for now, because the trend is largely in the wrong direction.</p>
<p>The paper is in good, or at least typical, company. The journalism craft has been almost entirely opaque during the monopoly/oligopoly era of media. Some of the reasons for this made sense, including the legal ones (though lawyers are always too cautious, because that&#8217;s their job). Apart from your column and the occasionally revealing remarks people make in the scheduled online chats, the Post is almost completely opaque.</p>
<p>Transparency takes several forms. I strongly believe that news organizations have a duty to explain to their audiences how they do their journalism, and why. Even the organizations that claim to have no world view should be telling people much more about the &#8220;how&#8221; &#8212; though too few do &#8212; because they&#8217;d help readers/viewers/listeners/etc. understand what it takes to do good journalism, assuming they actually do good journalism. It baffles me that an industry that wants to be perceived as better than the newcomers to the craft doesn&#8217;t grasp this, but it clearly doesn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>The &#8220;why&#8221; is more nuanced, especially for big organizations (at least in America). They could take a page from the newcomers.</p>
<p>The best journalistic bloggers are much more open on this; their world views and motivations are typically crystal clear. And their audiences, even people who disagree with those world views, can refract their own understanding of the topics through those lenses.</p>
<p>The response I get when I say these things is typically along these lines: But if journalists say what they think, they&#8217;ll call into question their objectivity. I <a href="http://dangillmor.typepad.com/dan_gillmor_on_grassroots/2005/01/the_end_of_obje.html">don&#8217;t believe in objectivity</a> in the first place. And the public already perceives journalists to be biased, which of course they are &#8212; though I don&#8217;t believe this is the same as unethical.</p>
<p>I wish that U.S. news organizations would drop the pretense of being impartial and having no world view. There&#8217;s no conflict between having a world view and doing great journalism.</p>
<p>When I go to London I buy the Guardian and the Telegraph. Both do excellent journalism. The <a href="http://guardian.co.uk">Guardian</a> covers the world from a slightly left-of-center standpoint, and the <a href="http://telegraph.co.uk">Telegraph</a> from a slightly right-of-center stance. I read both and figure I&#8217;m triangulating on the essence of (British establishment) reality. Even if I read just one, the paper&#8217;s overt frame of reference gives me a better way to understand what&#8217;s happening than if it pretended to be impartial. And &#8212; crucially &#8212; both of them run articles (and lots of op-eds) that either directly challenge their world views or, more routinely, include facts and context that runs contrary to what the editors and proprietors might wish was true. Relentless journalism&#8217;s independence of thought means, in particular, being willing or even eager to learn why your core assumptions could be wrong.</p>
<p>The Post had a profoundly obvious world view during the run-up to the Iraq War: pro-administration, pro-war &#8212; and it was reflected principally in the fact that the little journalism it did questioning the war rarely if ever made the front page, as opposed to relentless parroting of war-mongering from Bush administration insiders. The evidence is overwhelming, and even Post journalists have <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A58127-2004Aug11?language=printer">admitted</a> as much, though not in those precise words. I&#8217;m guessing that the newspaper&#8217;s editors, who can be as good as (or better than) anyone else in the field, would have done a better job of covering the opposing views (and facts) if the paper&#8217;s world view had been stated as a matter of policy, partly because the best journalists enjoy challenging conventional wisdom even when it&#8217;s from their own bosses.</p>
<p>When it comes to individual views and specifics about individual reporters and editors, I grant that this does get a bit more tricky. I&#8217;m not suggesting that the Post or anyone else put reporters&#8217; tax returns online. But I would suggest that when something they are, or believe, might be relevant to a reader that it&#8217;s OK, and maybe important, to let the reader know. (A religion reporters&#8217; faith, as in what religion or sect he follows (or absence of faith, for that matter) seems relevant to me.)</p>
<p>And I&#8217;d strongly suggest that while a random opinion or quip might be bothersome, letting journalists be human beings would have a better outcome in the end. Telling staff to hide all opinions doesn&#8217;t cause readers to trust you more. It tells them you&#8217;re hiding something, because they aren&#8217;t stupid.</p>
<p>The principle behind the Post&#8217;s social media policy is based on instincts derived from the 20th century monopoly/oligopoly business model. The wishful thinking it represents is unfortunate. It&#8217;s not going to work in the end, and in the meantime one of the world&#8217;s great news organizations will be losing ground that will be harder and harder to make up.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>One of journalism&#8217;s stupider, if relatively harmless, tendencies is to report with a straight face that so-and-so has sued someone for a specific amount of money. So you see <a href="http://www.dnj.com/article/20090923/SPORTS/909230338/1006/RSS02">stories that start</a> with language like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>NASHVILLE — Former Tennessee Titans receiver David Givens filed a $25 million lawsuit against the team Tuesday, alleging it withheld medical information from him and encouraged him to play despite being advised that his damaged knee could not withstand the rigors of NFL competition.</p></blockquote>
<p><em><a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idUSTRE58O3BK20090925"></a></em></p>
<p>Don&#8217;t be fooled. You&#8217;re being spun.</p>
<p>GIvens can tell the court he wants $25 million, or $50 million, or $10. But the jury, if it found the franchise liable for damages, could give him much less money &#8212; or more &#8212; depending on the judge&#8217;s instructions and guidelines, and its own whims.</p>
<p>Anyone can file a lawsuit demanding any amount of money. The amount in the claim is essentially meaningless. Putting mega-bucks demands into the legal papers is a way for filers of lawsuits to get cheap PR for their cause, and journalists fall for it every time.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m semi-pleased to see stories about the man who, as Reuters put it, has sued Bank of America for <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idUSTRE58O3BK20090925">1,784 billion, trillion dollars</a>. The story (and <a href="http://news.google.com/news/more?um=1&amp;cf=all&amp;ned=us&amp;cf=all&amp;ncl=dKKoVYfNJJZjrmMlsDp40ZAxgr_6M">others like it</a>) treats the claim like idiocy it is, and makes an appropriate joke of it, even quoting a mathematician who helps explain the vastness of the number.</p>
<p>Will Reuters now follow up by telling its reporters to stop assisting filers of lawsuits by providing sensationalist PR? I doubt it, but If I ran a news organization, we would never publish or broadcast the amount requested in a lawsuit. Let plaintiffs score their points in other ways.</p>

So, as what Maureen Dowd <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/26/opinion/26dowd.html?_r=1">today called</a> the &#8220;Case of the Blond Model and the Malicious Blogger&#8221; gains publicity steam, Dowd and too many other commentators seem to be missing some key points and drawing the wrong lessons.</p>
<p style="clear: both">To refresh your memory, if you haven&#8217;t heard about it, this case involves Liskula Cohen, a model who was on the receiving end of some vile comments next to suggestive pictures, posted under a pseudonym on one of gazillions of such blogs at Google&#8217;s <a href="http://blogger.com">Blogger</a> service. Cohen&#8217;s lawyer persuaded a judge that the posts were arguably defamatory, and the judge <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/18742841/Liskula-Cohen-Opinion">ordered</a> Google to turn over the email address and other logged information it had about the blogger. The company, after first denying Cohen&#8217;s request and saying she&#8217;d need a court order, then complied and handed over the information. The data trail led back to a Cohen acquaintance named Rosemary Port. Cohen, in a demonstration of her own better instincts, said she would forgive Port instead of suing her.</p>
<p style="clear: both">
<p style="clear: both">That&#8217;s where this nasty little incident might have ended. Unfortunately it appears to be heading off in new directions.</p>
<p style="clear: both">
<p style="clear: both">Port says she&#8217;s <a href="http://m.guardian.co.uk/?id=102202&amp;story=http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2009/aug/24/blogging-google">going to sue</a> Google, arguing that she had a right to confidentiality. Give me a break. I&#8217;m a privacy nut, but I believe Google did exactly the right thing in this instance, in part because it obeyed a clear order from a judge who also did the right thing.</p>
<p style="clear: both">
<p style="clear: both">No one can dispute that we have a category of human slime that uses online anonymity (or, usually more accurately, pseudonymity) to attack other people. These people, classic cowards, hide behind the virtual bushes to take potshots, and they do so with the ugliest kind of satisfaction.</p>
<p style="clear: both">
<p style="clear: both">But as Cohen&#8217;s case shows &#8212; the postings about her weren&#8217;t even close to being the worst material I&#8217;ve seen from anonymous sources &#8212;  online media creators aren&#8217;t exempt  from defamation laws, though it may take more effort to find out who they are. The judge in New York, Joan A. Madden, looked at the facts and, in my view, correctly decided that Port&#8217;s blog postings were sufficiently crude to justify Cohen&#8217;s plans to file a defamation lawsuit &#8212; not that they were absolutely defamatory, but that they were within the ballpark that could justify letting a jury decide.</p>
<p style="clear: both">
<p style="clear: both">Port, for her part, told reporters that almost no one would have known about her sleazy behavior had Cohen not gone to court in the first place and had Google not turned her name over. Talk about twisted logic. <em>Cohen</em>, and most likely some of their mutual acquaintances, knew about it. And the likelihood, given the Internet&#8217;s staying power, is that at least some others would have seen Port&#8217;s remarks, too. Let&#8217;s hope the courts toss any lawsuit from Port into the nearest trash can.</p>
<p style="clear: both">
<p style="clear: both">But, as sometimes happens, the larger case is growing, in part due to the large amount of attention it&#8217;s received from media of all varieties &#8212; newspapers, TV, radio and, of course, blogs. It&#8217;s turning into a morality play that could have a real impact on the issue of anonymity. If that impact comes in the form of helping us to establish new norms of behavior, great. If it turns into new laws, watch out.</p>
<p style="clear: both">
<p style="clear: both">One of the norms we&#8217;d be wise to establish is this: People who don’t stand behind their words deserve, in almost every case, no respect for what they say. In many cases, anonymity is a hiding place that harbors cowardice, not honor. The more we can encourage people to use their real names, the better. But if we try to force this, we&#8217;ll create more trouble than we fix.</p>
<p style="clear: both">
<p style="clear: both">People who&#8217;d ban anonymity don&#8217;t seem to realize that it&#8217;s technically impossible unless we&#8217;re willing to turn over all of our communications in every venue to a central authority &#8212; a system that would herald the end of liberty. They can&#8217;t really want such a regime, can they? Meanwhile, even that kind of structure could and would be hacked by motivated types, though with more difficulty.</p>
<p style="clear: both">
<p style="clear: both">Moreover, anonymity has crucially important value. We need it for whistleblowers, for political dissidents in dictatorships &#8212; for those who have important stories to tell but whose lives or livelihoods would be in jeopardy if their identities were exposed.</p>
<p style="clear: both">
<p style="clear: both">In other words, to save the heroes who tell us about vital matters, we have to recognize that we&#8217;ll also have people who use free speech to ignoble ends. When they cross the line to defamation, they deserve the woes they may bring on themselves.</p>
<p style="clear: both">
<p style="clear: both">But we don&#8217;t want, in the end, to turn everything over to the lawyers. The rest of us &#8212; the audience, if you will &#8212; need to establish some new norms as well.</p>
<p style="clear: both">
<p style="clear: both">We are far too prone to accepting what we see and hear. We need to readjust our internal BS meters in a media-saturated age.</p>
<p style="clear: both">
<p style="clear: both">So start with this principle: <em>When you read or hear a</em><em>n anonymous or pseudonymous attack on someone else, you should not just assume &#8212; barring persuasive evidence of the charge &#8212; that it&#8217;s false. Assume that the accuser is an outright, contemptible liar.</em></p>
<p style="clear: both">
<p style="clear: both">This wouldn&#8217;t solve the problem. But it would help.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><img src="http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/kindle.png" border="0" alt="kindle.png" width="145" height="170" align="right" />A number of folks whom I admire greatly have <a href="http://www.defectivebydesign.org/amazon1984">signed a petition</a> aimed at Amazon&#8217;s control-freakish policies with its Kindle e-book reader. The most notable recent example of what&#8217;s wrong with the Kindle is the <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/32014285/ns/technology_and_science-tech_and_gadgets/">remote-deleting of books</a> that people had bought (with a refund).</p>
<p>The irony in Amazon&#8217;s action, since the deletions included George Orwell&#8217;s <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four">1984</a></em>, contributed to the mini-firestorm that erupted. In any case, Jeff Bezos, Amazon&#8217;s CEO, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/tag/kindle/forum/ref=cm_cd_ecf_tft_tp?_encoding=UTF8&amp;cdForum=Fx1D7SY3BVSESG&amp;cdThread=Tx1FXQPSF67X1IU">publicly apologized</a>. That was a smart and welcome move, but his letter to the Amazon community carefully <em>didn&#8217;t</em> promise not to do it again. This disappoints me as an author, Kindle owner and owner of a small amount of Amazon stock. (And I&#8217;m glad to see that a student is <a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/technology/2009/07/highlights-from-the-1984-lawsuit-against-amazon.html">standing up in court</a> against what happened to his own note-taking in the electronic edition.)</p>
<p>The petition to Amazon was organized by the good folks at the <a href="http://fsf.org">Free Software Foundation</a>, an organization I respect immensely. You can read it <a href="http://www.defectivebydesign.org/amazon1984">here</a>.</p>
<p>Although I agree with almost everything the petition says, I declined to sign. My reason was the use of the word &#8220;demand&#8221; &#8212; a word that, as I said to a foundation staff member, feels wrong in every way.</p>
<p>It strikes me as hollow to demand anything. Just as the incessant use of the word &#8220;must&#8221; in newspapers editorials &#8212; as in &#8220;President Obama must do this or that&#8221; &#8212; betrays editorial writers&#8217; fundamental impotence in such matters, demanding that people do this or that seems so unlikely to lead to action that it&#8217;s nearly pointless.</p>
<p>I prefer to urge, and try to persuade. So here&#8217;s the petition language (which I proposed but which was not adopted) that I&#8217;d have gladly signed:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Our way of life based on the free exchange of ideas, in which books have and will continue to hold a central role. Devices like the Kindle are setting the standard for how people interact with books, but the use of software to control, monitor, or eliminate users&#8217; books from afar constitutes a clear threat to the free exchange of ideas.</em></p>
<p><em>That is one reason why we &#8212; readers, authors, publishers and librarians &#8212; strongly urge that Amazon remove from the Kindle device the ability to control or access the books its users have purchased. </em></p>
<p><em>Amazon&#8217;s assurances that it won&#8217;t abuse this power are insufficient. Having this power is the problem. Until the company gives up this capability, the company will be tempted to use it &#8212; or may be forced to use it, by narrow private interests or by governments. Whatever Amazon&#8217;s motives for maintaining this control may be, they are not nearly as important as the public&#8217;s freedom to read books without interference or supervision.</em></p>
<p><em>Meanwhile, we are actively seeking alternatives to the Kindle. We will support &#8212; with our dollars, and the common sense that when we buy something we should own it &#8212; the companies that understand, and provide, true freedom of speech in the marketplace of ideas.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>In the end I think Amazon will come around on this, but I also believe  the people there will be unnecessarily put off by your petition, which  may make it counterproductive to all of our goals.</p>
