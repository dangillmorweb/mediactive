	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Robert W. McChesney and John Nichols believe that <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/10/22/AR2009102203960.html">&#8220;journalists deserve subsidies, too</a>.&#8221; They argue that America is &#8220;nearing a point where we will no longer have more than minimal resources (relative to the nation&#8217;s size) dedicated to reporting the news.&#8221;</p>
<p>There&#8217;s every reason to dispute their woe-is-us assumption. There&#8217;s even more reason to say they are wildly off-base in calling for special subsidies for journalists.</p>
<p>The authors, longstanding activists in media reform, are exceedingly well-meaning. And they are more accurate than not when they say:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>We seek to renew a rich if largely forgotten legacy of the American free-press tradition, one that speaks directly to today&#8217;s crisis. The First Amendment necessarily prohibits state censorship, but it does not prevent citizens from using their government to subsidize and spawn independent media. </em></p>
<p><em>Indeed, the post-colonial press system was built on massive postal and printing subsidies. The first generations of Americans never imagined that the market would provide sound or sufficient journalism. The notion was unthinkable. They established enlightened subsidies, which broadened the marketplace of ideas and enhanced and protected core freedoms. Their initiatives were essential to America&#8217;s progress.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>If the authors had only pursued their logic, they&#8217;d have ended up at the only sensible conclusion &#8212; that taxpayers could well subsidize the equivalent of the postal and printing subsidies they celebrate (among many other infrastructure supports that helped get the news from one place to another, such as roads, never mind the <a href="http://mediactive.com/2009/05/13/governments-long-history-of-supporting-journalism/">variety of other government help</a> that&#8217;s gone to news organizations over the past several centuries.</p>
<p>What would following their logic lead us to in a digital world? That&#8217;s easy: We should collectively install dark fiber to every home and business where it&#8217;s feasible to do so, and put fiber as close to the ones that are too remote to make sense otherwise. It should be &#8220;dark fiber&#8221; &#8212; that is, data lines not controlled by government but available for others to light up to provide services for users.</p>
<p>This would not be about journalism only, any more than building roads in the 18th and 19th and 20th centuries was about helping newspapers deliver their goods to people&#8217;s homes and businesses. It would be about boosting trade of services and information (for-profit and not-for-profit), one part of which would be media.</p>
<p>We are seeing an explosion of creativity and innovation in media <em>and journalism</em> right now. Entrepreneurs and big companies alike are experimenting in new forms of journalism and ways to pay for it.</p>
<p>We have never had so much high-quality coverage in some areas, such as technology, as we have today. We have never had so much truly local conversation that has high value as we have today. And we will have vastly more tomorrow.</p>
<p>We may well be losing, at least temporarily, some of what <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=111985662">Alex Jones calls</a> &#8220;accountability journalism&#8221; &#8212; hard-nosed reporting of what powerful institutions, including government, are doing with our money and, in some cases, our lives. But to assume it will disappear and not be replaced, especially given some of the experiments we&#8217;re seeing, is grossly premature.</p>
<p>But Nichols and McChesney make that worst-case assumption, and veer off to this conclusion:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Saving newspapers may be impossible. But we can save journalism. Step one is to begin debating ways for enlightened public subsidies to provide a competitive and independent digital news media. Also, we should greatly expand funding for public and community media, and establish policies that help convert dying daily newspapers into post-corporate low-profit news operations that realize the potential of the Internet. If we do so, journalism and democracy will not just survive. They will flourish. </em></p></blockquote>
<p>We don&#8217;t need government support of this kind. It will lead us down a path that media reformers will rue: licensing of journalists, picking of winners and other pernicious outcomes.</p>
<p>Government surely does have a role, no question. But it should be to create the fundamental communications infrastructure on which tomorrow&#8217;s journalism can thrive.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<blockquote><p>Leonard Downie Jr. and Michael Schudson (Washington Post op-ed): <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/10/18/AR2009101801461.html?sid=ST2009101802019">New-model journalism needs community support</a>. <em>American society must now take some collective responsibility for supporting news reporting &#8212; as society has, at much greater expense, for public education, health care, scientific advancement and cultural preservation, through varying combinations of philanthropy, subsidy and government policy. It may not be essential to save or promote any particular news medium, including print newspapers. What is paramount is preserving independent, original, credible reporting, whether or not it is profitable, and regardless of the medium in which it appears.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The sentiments behind this executive summary of a <a href="https://stgcms.journalism.columbia.edu/cs/ContentServer/jrn/1212611716674/page/1212611716651/JRNSimplePage2.htm">new report</a> are fine ones. No one wants to see journalism disappear whether or not newspapers do.</p>
<p>But the authors&#8217; solution is, in part, another example of asking taxpayers to fix problems we can solve ourselves. </p>
<p>Before continuing, I should note that Len Downie, former executive editor at the Washington Post, is a colleague at the <a href="cronkite.asu.edu">Cronkite School</a> at Arizona State University. I admire him and his work, and the report he and co-author, a professor of communication at <a href="columbia.edu">Columbia University</a>, have released is an excellent compendium of some of exciting new projects under way in the journalism sphere.</p>
<p>In fact, their wide-ranging look at the new entrants &#8212; people and institutions trying journalism and business experiments amid the failure of newspapers &#8212; could well have been the basis for an entirely different conclusion, namely that we&#8217;re making wonderful progress, than the recommendations they come up with. </p>
<p>The authors especially seem to crave government intervention at several levels even as they praise market solutions. (In his well-reasoned post today Jeff Jarvis <a href="http://www.buzzmachine.com/2009/10/19/giving-up-on-the-news-business/">says</a> that the authors &#8220;are addressing the business problem of news without doing reporting on the business.&#8221; I agree with most of Jeff&#8217;s post but disagree in part on this point.)</p>
<p>Instead, as I read this, the authors effectively dismiss what they earlier surround with great praise, saying it&#8217;s not nearly enough to replace what we&#8217;re losing. Of course that&#8217;s true today (though there&#8217;s insufficient recognition of the deep and valuable news/information flow in important niche arenas that journalists rarely if ever covered in their monopoly days). It won&#8217;t be true in a few years if current trends persist.</p>
<p>Several of the recommendations make good sense (and are already happening in some cases), such as encouraging journalism schools to be part of the local media ecosystem in a more direct way; spurring philanthropy; and, a very good idea, persuading public broadcasting to turn its mission to a more local focus.</p>
<p>But when the authors call for collective action, watch out. What they&#8217;re talking about is using government. The only institutions that seem able to use government without being used are too-big-to-fail banks and military contractors; the rest of us fall into the inverse category. Journalists get government help at some peril.</p>
<p>For my money, the most problematic recommendation (among several mistaken ones) is the fifth:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>A national Fund for Local News should be created with money the Federal Communications Commission now collects from or could impose on telecom users, television and radio broadcast licensees, or Internet service providers and administered in open competition through state Local News Fund Councils.</em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Whoa. Think about it. Take taxpayers&#8217; money &#8212; this is a new tax we&#8217;re talking about, or diversion of current fees and taxes &#8212; and give it to councils that will pick winners, re-establishing a journalistic priesthood to replace the increasingly ingrown and unimaginative one we&#8217;ve had. Who&#8217;ll pick the councils, moreover? Government, that&#8217;s who, either directly or by proxy.</p>
<p>Now, government has long had a hand in supporting journalism, as I noted in <a href="http://mediactive.com/2009/05/13/governments-long-history-of-supporting-journalism/">this post</a> a few months ago. Some of that support has been indirect, such as postal subsidies (though even those were targeted by intention). Others, which were never justified, included the odious 1970s law, still in effect, that let newspapers combine business operations in communities to preserve the illusion of competition.</p>
<p>The only government intervention I&#8217;d support at this point would be the one that&#8217;s apparently not on the table: a taxpayer-funded wiring of America, putting fiber-optic lines everywhere, or at least to every curb. Let private businesses and local institutions light it up. Nothing would do more to spur media development of all kinds.</p>
<p>Look, we definitely do have a problem in the journalism craft. The upcoming period will be messy, at best. Maybe there will be a time for intervention in a more &#8220;collective&#8221; and direct way on the news. Maybe, but not now.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s watch the market work &#8212; a market that includes for-profit, not-for-profit, volunteer and all manner of new approaches, in addition to the remaking of some traditional methods. It&#8217;s increasingly clear to me that it <em>is</em> working. </p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p style="clear: both"><a href="http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/loc2.png" class="image-link"><img class="linked-to-original" src="http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/loc2-thumb.png" height="97" align="left" width="300" style=" display: inline; float: left; margin: 0 10px 10px 0;" /></a>I&#8217;ve been at the <a href="http://loc.gov">Library of Congress</a> for the past two days, in a workshop with a bunch of librarians, news folks and others discussing the long-term preservation of news in a digital era. My role turned out to be pushing for a greater recognition of the non-traditional news sources that are emerging in this networked world, including blogs, social networks and and hyper-dynamically generated material that shows up on screens in large part as a result of what the user wants (and sometimes creates), not solely what the provider thinks is important.</p>
<p style="clear: both">One thing first: I worship librarians. They are under-appreciated in the extreme. What they do enriches us all in a variety of ways. Sitting inside the Jefferson Building at the Library of Congress, in a room that overlooked the U.S. Capitol, I realized that the library is on higher ground than the Capitol itself. Seems reasonable.</p>
<p style="clear: both">The workshop had an understandable tilt toward the creators traditional media&#8217;s dominant life forms in the now-crumbling news ecosystem: newspapers and broadcasters. Saving what they do is unquestionably important. Putting analog content into digital form is a non-trivial issue, and even though the things they produce today are generally created first in digital formats, archiving is not a simple or, at the moment, inexpensive proposition. </p>
<p style="clear: both">As the cost of raw storage plummets, some of the archiving issues will ease, but others will remain. A key issue is the giant stinking pile of garbage known as today&#8217;s copyright system. It deters some uses of news that would be widely beneficial, and is fundamentally a barrier to public understanding, not an enhancement.</p>
<p style="clear: both">Newspapers have treated their own archives &#8212; essential parts of their communities&#8217; history &#8212; with utter disrespect. Some are unavailable, period. Others are on microfilm, with some of those being digitized by private companies that partner with newspapers mostly to create pay-walls that serve almost no one&#8217;s interest.</p>
<p style="clear: both">Digitizing and storing are all but meaningless if the result is (at best in many cases) costly access. Copyright law makes the situation worse, but the attitudes of the people who control the material are probably the bigger problem, especially now that they&#8217;re looking for any port in the fiscal storm that threatens to drown all but the sturdiest in the industry.</p>
<p style="clear: both">It&#8217;s good to see these folks at least acknowledging some of these issues. We don&#8217;t have as much time as we might like to solve them. Our histories &#8212; at least the ones created by traditional media &#8212; are in danger of disappearing, just when we have seen our best opportunity to ensure that they live on, not just as things we keep in vaults but as part of the toolset we all need to understand what&#8217;s been going on and what we can do about it. </p>
<p style="clear: both">One area where we can make a big difference, quickly, is in the part of media we call blogging (but which I define a bit more broadly). We&#8217;ll look at that in the next post.</p>

		<p><img src="http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/kindle.png" border="0" alt="kindle.png" width="145" height="170" align="right" />A number of folks whom I admire greatly have <a href="http://www.defectivebydesign.org/amazon1984">signed a petition</a> aimed at Amazon&#8217;s control-freakish policies with its Kindle e-book reader. The most notable recent example of what&#8217;s wrong with the Kindle is the <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/32014285/ns/technology_and_science-tech_and_gadgets/">remote-deleting of books</a> that people had bought (with a refund).</p>
<p>The irony in Amazon&#8217;s action, since the deletions included George Orwell&#8217;s <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four">1984</a></em>, contributed to the mini-firestorm that erupted. In any case, Jeff Bezos, Amazon&#8217;s CEO, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/tag/kindle/forum/ref=cm_cd_ecf_tft_tp?_encoding=UTF8&amp;cdForum=Fx1D7SY3BVSESG&amp;cdThread=Tx1FXQPSF67X1IU">publicly apologized</a>. That was a smart and welcome move, but his letter to the Amazon community carefully <em>didn&#8217;t</em> promise not to do it again. This disappoints me as an author, Kindle owner and owner of a small amount of Amazon stock. (And I&#8217;m glad to see that a student is <a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/technology/2009/07/highlights-from-the-1984-lawsuit-against-amazon.html">standing up in court</a> against what happened to his own note-taking in the electronic edition.)</p>
<p>The petition to Amazon was organized by the good folks at the <a href="http://fsf.org">Free Software Foundation</a>, an organization I respect immensely. You can read it <a href="http://www.defectivebydesign.org/amazon1984">here</a>.</p>
<p>Although I agree with almost everything the petition says, I declined to sign. My reason was the use of the word &#8220;demand&#8221; &#8212; a word that, as I said to a foundation staff member, feels wrong in every way.</p>
<p>It strikes me as hollow to demand anything. Just as the incessant use of the word &#8220;must&#8221; in newspapers editorials &#8212; as in &#8220;President Obama must do this or that&#8221; &#8212; betrays editorial writers&#8217; fundamental impotence in such matters, demanding that people do this or that seems so unlikely to lead to action that it&#8217;s nearly pointless.</p>
<p>I prefer to urge, and try to persuade. So here&#8217;s the petition language (which I proposed but which was not adopted) that I&#8217;d have gladly signed:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Our way of life based on the free exchange of ideas, in which books have and will continue to hold a central role. Devices like the Kindle are setting the standard for how people interact with books, but the use of software to control, monitor, or eliminate users&#8217; books from afar constitutes a clear threat to the free exchange of ideas.</em></p>
<p><em>That is one reason why we &#8212; readers, authors, publishers and librarians &#8212; strongly urge that Amazon remove from the Kindle device the ability to control or access the books its users have purchased. </em></p>
<p><em>Amazon&#8217;s assurances that it won&#8217;t abuse this power are insufficient. Having this power is the problem. Until the company gives up this capability, the company will be tempted to use it &#8212; or may be forced to use it, by narrow private interests or by governments. Whatever Amazon&#8217;s motives for maintaining this control may be, they are not nearly as important as the public&#8217;s freedom to read books without interference or supervision.</em></p>
<p><em>Meanwhile, we are actively seeking alternatives to the Kindle. We will support &#8212; with our dollars, and the common sense that when we buy something we should own it &#8212; the companies that understand, and provide, true freedom of speech in the marketplace of ideas.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>In the end I think Amazon will come around on this, but I also believe  the people there will be unnecessarily put off by your petition, which  may make it counterproductive to all of our goals.</p>

<p>More about this <a href="http://recoveringjournalist.typepad.com/recovering_journalist/2009/07/introducing-growthspur.html">on Mark&#8217;s blog</a>.</p>
<p>Count me as one of Mark&#8217;s fans. He&#8217;s had his setbacks, including the ill-fated <a href="http://recoveringjournalist.typepad.com/recovering_journalist/2007/07/backfence-lesso.html">Backfence</a> project (when it failed, that was the end of my Grassroots Media Bayosphere project as well, as we&#8217;d sold it to Backfence). But he has kept working to help journalism stay alive and thrive in this new century, and for that he deserves kudos.</p>
<p>How well will this project work? We won&#8217;t know for a while. But Mark has lined up some excellent colleagues, and he knows a great deal about the topic at hand.</p>
<p>Most importantly, he and his team are among the thousands of people who are reinventing media and information &#8212; experimenting our way into a future that seems certain to be one of plenty, not scarcity. That&#8217;s the best news of all in his announcement.</p>

		<p><img src="http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Time-frugal-cover.png" "padding-top: 2px; padding-right: 4px;" alt="Time frugal cover.png" border="0" width="101" height="131" align="right" /> A fierce and fascinating debate has broken out over the <a href="http://www.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,20090427,00.html">cover photo</a> on Time magazine&#8217;s April 27 print edition. Time paid a pittance for the picture &#8212; at least a pittance next to what big magazines normally pay for cover art &#8212; and that&#8217;s made a lot of professional photographers furious.</p>
<p>They should get over it. But they and their gifted-amateur and part-timer peers &#8212; especially the ones capturing breaking news events &#8212; should start agitating for a better marketplace than the ones available today. More on that below, but first some background:</p>
<p>The marketplace for photography in an Internet era has changed irrevocably. In 2006 <a href="http://citmedia.org/blog/2006/12/04/the-demise-of-the-professional-photojournalist/">I argued</a> that the professional who will feel the pain most in the short run are the folks who shoot spot-news pictures. I said, in part:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>They can’t possibly compete in the media-sphere of the future. We’re entering a world of ubiquitous media creation and access. When the tools of creation and access are so profoundly democratized, and when updated business models connect the best creators with potential customers, many if not most of the pros will fight a losing battle to save their careers.<br />
</em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>This was bad news for them, I acknowledged, but not for the rest of us &#8212; because someone with a camera (probably part of a phone) almost always would be in a position to capture relevant still photos and/or, increasingly, videos of newsworthy events. We&#8217;d have <em>more</em> valuable pictures, not less, and production values would take second place to authenticity and timeliness.</p>
<p>I also said that staff feature photographers were in less trouble. The Time cover suggests I was premature in that assessement, though I do believe that great artists would always have a market for their work.</p>
<p>The rub, as anyone who spends any serious time on <a href="http://flickr.com">Flickr</a> already knows, is that amateur photographers are doing incredible work. Few of them can match the consistent quality of what the pros do, but they don&#8217;t have to. Every one of us is capable of capturing one supremely memorable image. Whatever you&#8217;re looking for, you can find it on Flickr or other photo sites including the <a href="http://www.istockphoto.com/index.php">stock-photos service</a> where <a href="http://www.modelmayhem.com/po.php?thread_id=480730">Robert Lam</a> listed the picture that ended up on Time&#8217;s cover, a photo for which he said he was paid $30, according to <a href="http://www.modelmayhem.com/po.php?thread_id=480730">this conversation thread</a> on the Model Mayhem photo community site, which includes some strenuous objections from pro photographers.</p>
<p>It does strike me as absurd that a huge magazine with huge circulation can get an image like Lam&#8217;s for so little money. But that was his choice, and it was Time&#8217;s choice to take advantage of low price he was asking.</p>
<p>Just as some people gladly take the New York Times&#8217; absurdly low pay when their freelance articles make it into the paper&#8217;s news and op-ed pages, some photographers gladly sell their work for peanuts to Time. They have their own reasons, which can range from getting valuable exposure &#8212; so they can (try to) charge more for subsequent work &#8212; to not needing the money staffers and more famous people can demand.</p>
<p>This gets trickier, it seems to me, when it comes to breaking news, where news organizations derive enormous benefits from having the right image or video at the right time and too frequently get it for less than peanuts. Indeed, practically every news organization now invites its audience to submit pictures and videos, in return for which the submitters typically get zip.</p>
<p>Which is why we need a more robust marketplace than any I&#8217;ve seen so far, namely a real-time auction system.</p>
<p>The sites currently promoting citizen journalists&#8217; work don&#8217;t offer anything of this sort, as far as I can tell. This isn&#8217;t to say I don&#8217;t like those sites, which include <a href="http://nowpublic.com">NowPublic</a> and <a href="http://demotix.com">Demotix</a>, because I like them a great deal. But someone needs to go further.</p>
<p>How would a real-time auction system work? The flow, I&#8217;d imagine, would go like this:</p>
<p>Photographer captures breaking news event on video or audio, and posts the work to the auction site. Potential buyers, especially media companies, get to see watermarked thumbnails and then start bidding. A time limit is enforced in each case. The winning bid goes to the journalist, minus a cut to the auction service.</p>
<p>The premium, then, would be on timeliness and authenticity. One or two images/videos would be likely to command relatively high prices, and everything else would be worth considerably less.</p>
<p>Eventually, someone will do this kind of business &#8212; which could also be useful for eyewitness text accounts of events. For the sake of the citizen journalists who are not getting what they deserve for their work, I hope it&#8217;s sooner than later.</p>

		<p>Like many of us, Ed Felten at Freedom to Tinker was puzzled by the news-article registry system <a href="http://www.ap.org/pages/about/pressreleases/pr_072309a.html">announced by AP</a> last week. After taking a look at it, he concluded that, yes, it <a href="http://freedom-to-tinker.com/blog/felten/aps-drm-announcement-much-ado-about-nothing">makes no sense</a> whatever and isn&#8217;t worth the fretting that&#8217;s emanating from some quarters. Key quotes:</p>
<p><em><br />
<blockquote>As far as I can tell, the underlying technology is based on hNews, a microformat for news, shown in the AP diagram, that was announced by AP and the Media Standards Trust two weeks before the recent AP announcement.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for AP, the hNews spec bears little resemblance to AP&#8217;s claims about it. hNews is a handy way of annotating news stories with information about the author, dateline, and so on. But it doesn&#8217;t &#8220;encapsulate&#8221; anything in a &#8220;wrapper&#8221;, nor does it do much of anything to facilitate metering, monitoring, or paywalls.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>It seems that there is much less to the AP&#8217;s announcement than meets the eye. If there&#8217;s a story here, it&#8217;s in the mismatch between the modest and reasonable underlying technology, and AP&#8217;s grandiose claims for it.
</p></blockquote>
<p></em></p>
<p>The AP and its newspaper owners are starting to remind us the music industry and its attack-dog RIAA. That&#8217;s sad, in the extreme.</p>

		<p>ZDNet reports that Sergey Brin believes newspapers <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/?p=18770" style="text-decoration: none;"><cite style=""><span style="text-decoration: underline;">can still prosper.</span></cite></a> Quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>If newspapers take the time during the transition, to figure out what the next model might be, they can have a “strong sustainable form of revenue” for the future.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kamoteus/2409237787/" target="_top"><a href="http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/news-racks.jpg"><img src="http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/news-racks-tm.jpg" width="93" height="139" alt="News racks" style="float:left;" /></a></a></p>
<p>Nope. It&#8217;s too late for almost all of them, particularly the regional papers in cities of any size. They make no sense economically.</p>
<p>They <em>may</em> be sustainable in some form. But they have almost no chance, at this point, of any strength in their markets. They blew whatever opportunity they had a long time ago, by failing to recognize reality or, even if they understood what was happening, by failing to do anything serious to change while they had the chance.</p>
<p>When Brin, Eric Schimdt and other Googlers make these kinds of statements, are they trying to smooth the rocky relations they have with the industry? Or do they really believe this stuff? I suspect the former. They&#8217;re too smart to buy what they&#8217;re saying.</p>

		<p>A New York Times reporter asks an interesting question &#8212; <cite><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/17/weekinreview/17rich.html?ref=books&amp;pagewanted=all">How Much Should an E-Book Cost?</a> <span style="font-style: normal;">&#8212; in a Week in Review article, but her reporting is so shallow that the answer is murky at best.</span></cite></p>
<p><img id="kindle-999.png" style="padding-top: 2px; padding-right: 4px; float: left;" src="http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/kindle-999.png" alt="kindle pic 999" width="257" height="147" />She starts this piece with an anecdote about a best-seller by political thriller writer David Baldacci. The book&#8217;s Amazon Kindle price was originally set at over $15, but that price set off a rebellion among the author&#8217;s fans, one of whom wrote on the comments at Amazon that the price was just too high to bother with his work.</p>
<p>The fan&#8217;s comment, Rich writes:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>was a chilling sentiment for authors and publishers, who have grown used to an average cover price of $26 for a new hardcover. Now, in the evolving Kindle world, $9.99 is becoming the familiar price. But is that justified just because paper has been removed from the equation?</em></p>
<p><em>For many readers, this may sound like sufficient reason. Buying music, after all, is so much cheaper now that there aren’t discs and plastic cases. Shouldn’t the same logic apply to books? And if not, won’t the temptation to steal electronic copies online simply increase?<br />
</em></p>
<p><em>Publishers and authors say it is much more complicated than the cost of paper and shipping. The lower e-book price “is not sustainable,” said Mr. Baldacci, whose novels regularly rise to the top of hardcover best seller lists. If readers insist on cut-rate electronic books, he said, “unfortunately there won’t be anyone selling it anymore because you just can’t make any money.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>First things first: The price of Baldacci&#8217;s book was re-set at $9.99 (a price I will henceforth refer to as $10), and it&#8217;s selling like digital hotcakes; I guess you can make money this way, after all. Nowhere in the article is this mentioned. I truly hope that&#8217;s a reflection of sloppy editing, not incompetent reporting.</p>
<p>Now, sellers have every right to charge more for popular books, especially when they’re new. This is basic supply and demand. But the revolt by Amazon customers has had everything to do with the publishing industry&#8217;s belief that it can charge higher prices for inferior products.</p>
<p>The kinds of books I buy for my Kindle, as I noted in a <a href="http://voices.allthingsd.com/20090511/kindle-hikes-book-prices-and-adds-to-my-ambivalence/" target="_top">recent piece</a> for the All Things Digital site, fall generally under the casual entertainment category. I buy a Kindle book the way I buy a movie ticket &#8212; for books, like most movies, that I’ll read or watch once and forget about. A physical book is more like a DVD–something I want to own and enjoy again and again.</p>
<p>So my Kindle purchases are like the books I used to buy in airport newsstands, such as mysteries, thrillers and semi-trashy novels that I’d sometimes leave in hotels or airplane seat-back pockets once I’d finished them. And once I got accustomed to reading e-books, I started doing something that had been out of character in the analog era: buying new books that, in print, were available in hardcover only. Why? The $10 price felt right. In fact, my new-book purchases soared.</p>
<p>Then the Kindle prices started soaring for new best-sellers. I stopped buying. (I save these titles to a list I keep on the Amazon website, called “Too expensive on Kindle,” and periodically check to see if the price has dropped. So far, not yet on any of these.)</p>
<p>Hiking prices this way creates a bad deal for the customer. Amazon’s price for a new hardcover is typically just a couple of dollars higher. This means I could buy the hardcover, read it and donate it to my local library, and–after the tax deduction–come out ahead. I’d do even better taking the book to my local used-book store and getting cash.</p>
<p>The ability to give away or sell a used book is called the &#8220;<a href="http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#109" target="_top">First Sale Doctrine</a>&#8221; in copyright law. But by sending me a digital file and tethering that file to a specific device, Amazon and the publishers have removed my right to transfer it, and thereby destroyed a portion of the book&#8217;s value. By all rights they <em>should</em> offer me a better price, considerably better, than the hardcover (or, for that matter, softcover) edition.</p>
<p>Nowhere in Rich&#8217;s article does she even hint at this. Moreover, she appears to entirely take the word of publishers on several key facts, notably when they claim that Amazon&#8217;s $10 price is a loss-leader and not a price to which they&#8217;ve agreed. An Amazon customer service person told me that the higher new prices for Kindle books were a reflection of the publishers&#8217; decision that they, not Amazon, wanted to charge higher prices.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not saying all this to defend Amazon (in which I own a small amount of stock). In fact, I find the Kindle an extremely troubling device, in part because of the way it removes my rights to do what I want with what I&#8217;ve purchased. Amazon&#8217;s digital rights management system is, like that of the DRM employed by the entertainment industry for movies and music (thankfully disappearing with the latter), a system for restricting customer rights, and it&#8217;s bad news in every way.</p>
<p>Moreover, I agree with Cory Doctorow that the publishing industry is foolish to allow Amazon to set the terms of its future existence, as Amazon is certainly trying to do. The publishers could market their own electronic versions and cut out the middleman entirely (like my publisher, <a href="http://oreilly.com">O&#8217;Reilly Media</a> &#8212; though O&#8217;Reilly sells via Amazon, too, in non-DRM versions in all cases). Amazon&#8217;s value-add, however &#8212; or their own myopia &#8212; is sufficiently robust that they toe the line, at least in part.</p>
<p>The whining by author Baldacci, unchallenged by reporter Rich, is just pathetic. No one is forcing him to release his books in digital form. He and his publisher are entirely free to say no, or to offer their own digital edition. The real worry, as Rich does report:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>The doomsday scenario for publishing is that the e-book versions cannibalize higher-price print sales. Publishing houses, already suffering from the recession, could be forced to cut author advances or lay off more editors.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Ah, now we understand what&#8217;s really going on in this situation. It&#8217;s about the enormous advances that Baldacci might have to trim. It&#8217;s the possibility that people will buy at the paperback price (actually higher) for a new book, not that they&#8217;ll stop reading what authors write.</p>
<p>The business is definitely changing. It&#8217;s too bad that publishers and rich authors are resisting change with all their might.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s equally problematic that journalists on these issues can&#8217;t be bothered to dig just a little deeper when they raise important questions.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>UPDATED</p>
<p>In 1791, James Madison penned a <a href="http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/v1ch2s26.html" target="_top">short essay</a> that foretold a long, and ongoing, financial involvement by government in journalism. Madison said, in part:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Whatever facilitates a general intercourse of sentiments, as good roads, domestic commerce, a free press, and particularly a circulation of newspapers through the entire body of the people, and Representatives going from, and returning among every part of them, is equivalent to a contraction of territorial limits, and is favorable to liberty, where these may be too extensive.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.postalmuseum.si.edu/exhibits/2a1h_1792act.html" target="_top"></a><a href="http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/postoffice-act1792.jpg"><img style="float:left; padding-top:2px; padding-right:3px;" src="http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/postoffice-act1792-tm.jpg" alt="postoffice act1792.jpg" width="190" height="198" /></a>The following year, partly in response to Madison&#8217;s advice, Congress passed the Post Office Act of 1792. One of key provisions &#8212; in what, looking back, is a pivotal development of a robust and free press in America &#8212; let newspaper publishers mail papers for extremely low prices. It was an outright subsidy, for a social purpose.</p>
<p>The goal wasn&#8217;t to give newspaper owners a special deal because they were nice people (many were not) or would support government positions (many did not). It was to ensure that knowledge would spread as quickly, and as widely, as possible. The First Amendment forbade interference in what people could publish; the Post Office law provision helped make it financially feasible to ensure that other people could <em>receive and read</em> what was published.</p>
<p>By all historical accounts, the 1792 law worked. It was central to the rise of the nation as a society based on knowledge.</p>
<p>More than two centuries later, as the newspaper business falls on hard times that may be terminal, we&#8217;re hearing some calls for a taxpayer bailout of the industry, on the grounds that their journalism plays such a vital role in society that taxpayers <a href="http://www.thenation.com/doc/20090406/nichols_mcchesney/single" target="_top">should subsidize it directly</a>. Today, a member of Congress described at a conference <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:SN00673:@@@D&amp;summ2=m&amp;" target="_top">his proposed legislation</a> that would exempt newspapers from income taxes in certain circumstances.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m against direct subsidies. They are poisonous, especially so if they are designed to prop up a business that is failing in part because it was so transcendentally greedy in its monopoly era that it passed on every opportunity to survive against real financial competition. In my view, the newspaper industry deserves to die at this point.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not against intervention at a more basic level, as I&#8217;ll discuss below &#8212; namely, a build-out of fiber optic lines to every home and business in America so that everyone can compete freely in a true marketplace of knowledge.</p>
<p>But as people decry or laugh off a bailout of newspapers, as the New York Times&#8217; David Carr <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/11/business/media/11carr.html?_r=1&amp;scp=2&amp;sq=carr&amp;st=cse" target="_top">did yesterday</a> in his column, they should remember that government has never entirely lacked financial influence &#8212; and it doesn&#8217;t lack it now &#8212; over the journalism business.</p>
<p>Governments play major roles in the success or failure of all kinds of business. How corporations do business, and which ones pay which taxes, are decided by lawmakers. But journalism organizations have enjoyed their share of special treatment &#8212; and we should be glad, based on our nation&#8217;s early history, that they did.</p>
<p>Intervening via the mail, as noted above, was the linchpin. A few decades after the Post Office Act of 1792, Alexis De Tocqueville traveled around the states to research his pathbreaking volumes on <em><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/815" target="_top">Democracy in America</a><span style="font-style: normal;">.</span></em> He observed how widely knowledge had spread in a largely rural nation. The essential instrument of this, he explained: &#8220;The post, that great instrument of intellectual intercourse, now reaches into the backwoods.&#8221;</p>
<p>By the mid-1800s, says Bruce Bimber in his book, <em><a href="http://cambridge.org/us/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521804929" target="_top">Information and American Democracy</a></em> , our postal system became the most dependable and comprehensive in the world. It was an unprecedented exercise in governmental assistance, Bimber argues &#8212; “a kind of Manhattan project of communication” that helped fuel the rise of the first truly mass medium.</p>
<p>Support for media has been a long-running thread. Even in the 20th Century, favorable mail rates helped countless magazines and newsletters stay solvent (or better). The rise of the Time Inc. magazine empire was aided immeasurably by the fact that it could mail its publications at a cost to the publisher that barely began to cover the actual cost to the system. (In the 21st Century, Time&#8217;s <a href="http://thephoenix.com/Boston/News/43481-Media-monopolies-kill/" target="_top">maneuvering</a> to ensure its own favorable rates, at the expense of publishers of smaller journals, made some economic sense but also had a odiously anticompetitive aspect.)</p>
<p>Newspapers have enjoyed other special federal and local advantages, meanwhile. One of the most flagrant special-interest favors in U.S. history has to be the <a href="http://resource.lawlinks.com/Content/Legal_Research/US_code/Title_15/title_15_43.htm" target="_top">Newspaper Preservation Act of 1970</a>, in which newspaper publishers got Congress and the Nixon administration to give the industry an exemption from antitrust laws. (I spent more than a decade at a company that was helped by this law.)</p>
<p>In many states, newspapers get special tax treatment, notably exemption from sales taxes. The state of Washington, for example, just <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2009212482_apwanewspapertaxcuts.html" target="_top">cut newspapers&#8217; main business taxes</a> by 40 percent (to the same rate enjoyed by Boeing and timber companies, the state&#8217;s most powerful industries).</p>
<p>Print publications haven&#8217;t been the only beneficiaries of government favors. The gifts to the newspaper and magazine businesses are dwarfed by what <a href="http://www.newamerica.net/publications/policy/art_spectrum_lobbying" target="_top">broadcasters carved away from the taxpayers</a>: namely free use of the public&#8217;s airwaves. Local TV broadcasters, in particular, took advantage of this windfall, worth hundreds of billions of dollars over the decades, to make money at a rate that made even newspaper shareholders envious. (And local TV &#8220;news&#8221; has been, for the most part, a cesspool of violence, celebrity gossip and trivia that would have to improve to be mediocre; newspapers are only now becoming as lousy as local TV news has been through its entire history.)</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve only cited a few of the ways the nation&#8217;s governments have been doing financial favors for the journalism business. Consider newspaper racks on your community&#8217;s sidewalks; they&#8217;re a subsidy in their own right, because not everyone can put a rack there. I could list many other special favors, but you get the idea.</p>
<p>The key point, again, is that calls for a federal bailout don&#8217;t come in the context of hands-off treatment in the past &#8212; even though I personally find the direct subsidy idea abhorrent for all kinds of reasons, not least the way current proposals would protect enterprises that manifestly don&#8217;t deserve it and the near certainty that such a bailout would lead to more direct government interference in the journalism itself.</p>
<p>What could government do? The 1792 Post Office Act had a noble outcome, and is instructive for today. So is a more recent federal endeavor: the Interstate highway system.</p>
<p>In the 1950s, America’s state and local highways were relatively well developed. What the nation decided it needed, and what corporate America couldn’t begin to provide, was a robust system of long-distance roads.</p>
<p>With data, the reverse is true: the long-distance data highways, the “backbone” networks, exist in abundance. What we really need now is better local conveyances, the ones running to and into our homes. Big telecom carriers say they’ll provide these connections &#8212; that is, they <em>may</em> provide these connections if they feel like it &#8212; only if we allow them to control the content that flows on those lines.</p>
<p>Imagine if we’d given the interstates to corporations that could decide what kinds of vehicular traffic could use them. If you want to worry about a threat to the journalism of tomorrow, consider the power being collected by the so-called &#8220;broadband&#8221; providers right now.</p>
<p>If we&#8217;re going to spend taxpayers&#8217; money in ways that could help journalism, let&#8217;s build out the data networks, by installing fiber everywhere we can possibly put it. Let private and public enterprises light it up, and let that market thrive &#8212; a market of ideas and business models based on the same principle America stood on in its early days, namely widespread access to knowledge. I&#8217;d be delighted to see my tax dollars used for that purpose, and I&#8217;m betting most other people would, too.</p>
