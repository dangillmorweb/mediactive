		<p>UPDATED</p>
<p><a href="http://www.latimes.com/la-na-fort-hood-vigil-sl,0,1154265.storylink"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-918 alignleft" style="margin: 3px;" title="candles" src="http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/candles-150x150.jpg" alt="candles" width="90" height="90" /></a>In the minutes and hours after an Army officer <a href="http://news.google.com/news/more?um=1&amp;cf=all&amp;ned=us&amp;cf=all&amp;ncl=daab1UqJeJh0YNMaDYsOGigATwtEM">opened fire</a> on his fellow soldiers at Fort Hood, Texas, last week,  the media floodgates opened in a now-standard way. A torrent of news reports and commentary poured from the scene, the immediate community and the Pentagon, amplified by corollary data, informed commentary and rank speculation from journalists, bloggers, podcasters, Tweeters, texters and more.</p>
<p>Also standard in this age of fast news was the quality of the early information: utterly unreliable, and mostly wrong. The shooter was dead; no he wasn&#8217;t. There were two accomplices; no there weren&#8217;t. And so on. (See Greg Marx&#8217;s <a href="http://www.cjr.org/campaign_desk/jumping_to_confusion.php">&#8220;Jumping to Confusion&#8221; </a>at CJR, and Glenn Greenwald&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2009/11/06/reporting/index.html">media orgy</a>&#8221; post at Salon.)</p>
<p><object style="width: 240px; height: 149px;" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="240" height="149" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/qwS5uLk_1z4&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0&amp;border=1" /><param name="align" value="right" /><param name="vspace" value="3" /><param name="hspace" value="3" /><embed style="width: 240px; height: 149px;" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="240" height="149" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/qwS5uLk_1z4&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0&amp;border=1" hspace="3" vspace="3" align="right"></embed></object>This was not, as several critics have claimed, a failure of citizen journalism. (That the most prominent such accusation came from a web-news operation that is notorious for its rumor-mongering and fact-challenged ways is too rich for words, and definitely not going to draw a link from me.) There was plenty of bullshit to go around that day, at all levels of media. Lots of people quoted President Obama&#8217;s admonition (watch the video) to <a href="http://content.usatoday.com/communities/theoval/post/2009/11/obama-speaks-on-fort-hood-as-well-as-high-unemployment/1">wait for the facts</a>, but almost no one followed it. And almost no one will heed Army Gen. George William Casey Jr.&#8217;s <a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/44/2009/11/08/restraint_urged_in_fort_hood_s.html?wprss=44">advice</a> on Sunday, to not jump to conclusions &#8220;based on little snippets of information that come out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Like many other people who&#8217;ve been burned by believing too quickly, I&#8217;ve learned to put almost all of what journalists call &#8220;breaking news&#8221; into the categories of gossip or, in the words of a scientist friend, &#8220;interesting if true.&#8221; That is, even though I gobble up &#8220;the latest&#8221; from a variety of sources, the closer the information is in time to the actual event, the more I assume it&#8217;s unreliable if not false.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow_Food"><img class="size-full wp-image-915 alignleft" style="margin: 3px;" title="Snail" src="http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/Screen-shot-2009-11-08-at-3.43.46-PM.png" alt="Snail" width="76" height="56" /></a>It&#8217;s my own version of &#8220;slow news&#8221; &#8212; an expression I first heard on Friday, coined by my friend <a href="http://ethanzuckerman.com/">Ethan Zuckerman</a> in a wonderful riff off the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow_Food">slow-food</a> movement. We were at a <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu">Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society</a> retreat in suburban Boston, in a group discussion of ways to improve the quality of what we know when we have so many sources from which to choose at every minute of the day.</p>
<p>One of society&#8217;s recently adopted cliches is the &#8220;24-hour news cycle&#8221; &#8212; the recognition that the once-a-day, manufacturing-based version of journalism has essentially passed into history for those who consume and create news via digital systems. Now, it&#8217;s said, we get news every hour of every day, and media creators work tirelessly to fill those hours with new stuff.</p>
<p>(UPDATE: Yes, I am aware that some print publications can, though few do, provide actual perspective. As several commenters have noted, meanwhile, the notion of slowing things down to achieve more perspective has been in the wild for a while now, though aimed more at the journalists; note Paul Bradshaw&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/pda/2009/jun/01/channel4-research1">slow journalism</a>&#8221; observation; Kirk Ross&#8217; <a href="http://pjnet.org/post/1615/">ideas</a> and this from <a href="http://snarkmarket.com/2005/721">Matt Thompson</a>. What I&#8217;m suggesting, as noted, is much more about audiences. See update at end.)</p>
<p>That 24-hour news cycle needs further adjustment. The first is that an hourly news cycle is itself too long. The latest can come at any minute in an era of TV police chases, Twitter and twitchy audiences. Call it the 1,440 minute news cycle.</p>
<p>Rapid-fire news is about speed, which has two main purposes for the provider. The first is human competitiveness, the desire to be first. In journalism newsrooms, scoops are a coin of the realm.</p>
<p>The second imperative is audience. Being first draws a crowd. Crowds can be turned into influence, money or both. Witness cable news channels&#8217; desperate hunt for &#8220;the latest&#8221; when big events are under way, even though the latest is so often the rankest garbage.</p>
<p>This applies not just to raw information (often wrong, remember) that&#8217;s the basis for breaking news. It&#8217;s also the case, for example, for the blogger who offers up the first sensible-sounding commentary that puts the &#8220;news&#8221; into perspective. The winners in the online commentary derby &#8212; which is just as competitive, though for lower financial stakes, as  &#8212; are the quick and deft writers who tell us what it means. That they&#8217;re often basing these perspectives on lies or well-meaning falsehoods seems to matter less than being early to comment.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not arguing here against human nature. We all want to know what&#8217;s going on, and the bigger the calamity the more we want to know. Nothing is going to change that, and nothing should.</p>
<p>Nor is this a new phenomenon. Speculation has passed for journalism in all media eras. Every commercial plane crash, for example, is followed by days (now more like minutes and hours) of brazen guessing by so-called experts who, to be sure, are occasionally proved correct after months of actual investigation by the real experts. Sometimes we never know the truth.</p>
<p>But the advent of 1,440 minute news cycle (should we call it the 86,400 second news cycle?), which brings with it an insatiable appetite for something new to talk about, should literally give us pause. Again and again, we&#8217;ve seen that initial assumptions can be grossly untrustworthy.</p>
<p>We all know that the Texas shooter wasn&#8217;t killed during his rampage, as was first reported. That&#8217;s because the story was still fresh enough, and the saturation coverage was ongoing, when it emerged that he hadn&#8217;t been shot dead by law enforcement.</p>
<p>But we all &#8220;know&#8221; things that were subsequently found to be untrue, in part because journalists typically don&#8217;t report outcomes with the same passion and play that they report the initial news. We&#8217;ve all seen videos of people who&#8217;ve been arrested  but who were later acquitted; yet the inherent bias in crime reporting has left reputations of innocent people shattered. And how many of us hear a report that such-and-such product or behavior has been found to raise cancer risk, but never hear the follow up that the report is either false or misleading?</p>
<p>The rapid-fire news system&#8217;s abundance of falsehoods has other causes than simple speed, including the decline of what&#8217;s supposed to be a staple of journalism: fact checking before running with a story.</p>
<p>Citing the grotesque &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_balloon_incident">balloon boy</a>&#8221; stunt, <a href="http://shirky.com">Clay Shirky</a> (also a friend) observed recently &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/cshirky/status/5020391901">in a Tweet</a>, no less &#8212; that &#8220;fact-checking is way down, and after-the-fact checking is way WAY up.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not entirely sure the balloon-boy situation is the best example of this phenomenon, because there weren&#8217;t all that many facts journalists <em>could</em> check during the time the balloon was in the air. The family&#8217;s publicly weird ways should have prompted much more skepticism, earlier than it did, but journalists went with the story in front of them.</p>
<p>Clay&#8217;s point is absolutely right in a general sense, however. It lends weight to slow news, to the idea that we all might be wise to think before we react, just as most of us failed to do during the early hours and days of the &#8220;#amazonfail&#8221; situation last April. As he <a href="http://www.shirky.com/weblog/2009/04/the-failure-of-amazonfail/">wrote then</a>, a lot of us were wrong and believed things that turned out not to be true &#8212; and we reacted with fury to something that was a mistake, not evil design. (I am one of those people.)</p>
<p>I rely in large part on gut instincts when I make big decisions, but my gut only gives me good advice when I&#8217;ve immersed myself in the facts about things that are important. This applies, more than ever, to news, where we need to be skeptical of just about everything we read, listen to and watch, though not equally skeptical.</p>
<p>A corollary to that is increasingly clear: to wait a bit, for evidence that is persuasive, before deciding what&#8217;s true and what&#8217;s not.</p>
<p>It comes down to this: The faster the news accelerates, the slower I&#8217;m inclined to believe anything I hear &#8212; and the harder I look for the coverage that pulls together the most facts with the most clarity about what&#8217;s known and what&#8217;s speculation.</p>
<p>Call it slow news. Call it critical thinking. Call it anything you want. Give some thought to adopting it for at least some of your media consumption, and creation.</p>
<p>UPDATE (and welcome to the <a href="http://boingboing.net">BoingBoing</a> crew): I shouldn&#8217;t have to say this, but several tweets have suggested that the answer is, uh, print and quality broadcasting. Newspapers and magazines and network news.</p>
<p>Of course this is true, in part. I cherish the New Yorker magazine (among others), and the dwindling number of daily newspapers and broadcasters that try to do this part of their jobs properly. To the extent that audiences decide this matters to them, maybe they&#8217;ll pick up some old habits.</p>
<p>But this isn&#8217;t about saving the old guard, and it really isn&#8217;t even about fixing (some of) what&#8217;s wrong with journalism. It&#8217;s mostly about persuading audiences to, among other things, &#8220;take a deep breath&#8221; before leaping to conclusions, as PaidContent&#8217;s Staci Kramer <a href="http://twitter.com/sdkstl/status/5544986523">tweeted</a>. (I don&#8217;t trust journalists to do this anymore, with too few exceptions.)</p>
<p>In a practical sense, we can help it along if we find ways to preserve a happy by-product of the manufacturing process. Or, as Clay puts it in an email, &#8220;the idea &#8212; that we have to get back, by design, the kinds of things we used to get as side-effects of the environment &#8212; is so important right now, and especially for news.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ethan Zuckerman also replied on his blog in a post called &#8220;<a href="http://www.ethanzuckerman.com/blog/2009/11/09/why-we-fall-for-fast-news/">Why we fall for fast news</a>&#8221; &#8212; as always, great insight. Excerpt:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Why do we persistently refresh news, looking for updates? (See </em><a href="http://www.ethanzuckerman.com/blog/2008/08/09/aps-ethnography-of-news-consumption/"><em>my comments on AP’s ethnography of news consumption</em></a><em>, which suggests that this is a common pattern.) It makes sense for certain types of news – if you’re directly impacted by an event, tracking a storm enroute to your town, for instance. But that’s not why we refresh most news – it’s rare that having the most timely (and, as Dan suggests, the least careful) information has a direct impact on our well-being.</em></p>
<p><em>Here are a couple of possibilities:</em></p>
<p><em>&#8211; The media made us do it. We don’t want to eat fast food, but that’s all we’re fed, due to the newsroom factors Dan suggests.</em></p>
<p><em>&#8211; We’re bored. AP’s “deep dive” suggests that relentless refreshing is something we do mostly when we’ve got nothing better to do.</em></p>
<p><em>&#8211; We’re building social capital. If we’ve got the most up-to-date information on the breaking news, we can use it to open conversations with friends and position ourselves as in the know, raising our stature.</em></p>
<p><em>&#8211; We’re narrative junkies. A breaking news story is like a novel that ends after a few chapters – we keep reloading in the hopes that someone will tell us the rest of the story.</em></p>
<p><em>I suspect there’s some truth to each of those explanations… and I suspect that each is badly incomplete. I also suspect that figuring out what drives our patterns of news consumption, and our susceptibility to fast, often-wrong news is critical for Dan’s slow-news movement to gain momentum.</em></p></blockquote>

		<p>Rupert Murdoch&#8217;s influence on the Wall Street Journal has not been the disaster many feared it would be when News Corp., the company he controls, bought Dow Jones several years ago. In many ways, the paper has actually improved.</p>
<p>The worry was that Murdoch would do what he&#8217;s done at almost every other media property he controls: Turn the journalism toward political ends. The Journal&#8217;s editorial page has been an entirely predictable arm of the American political right for some time now. Would that infect the news columns as well?</p>
<p>It appears that this is indeed happening. That&#8217;s the significance &#8212; assuming this is not a one-time case of an editor going overboard &#8212; of a news story in yesterday&#8217;s paper, which carried the headline, <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB125694593227919879.html">State Death Taxes Are the Latest Worry</a> and began this way:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>With the federal estate tax disappearing for most people, state death taxes have emerged as a surprise new worry.</em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>This is not neutral language. Nor is it accurate. It&#8217;s a deliberate perversion of language to make a political point; dead people do not pay taxes. Their estates and heirs do.</p>
<p>(The people who oppose estate/inheritance taxes have a variety of arguments against the practice. I side with <a href="http://www.forbes.com/2007/11/14/warren-buffett-tax-markets-cx_er_1114autofacescan02.html">Bill Gates Sr., Warren Buffett, several Rockefellers and lots of other people</a> who believe the arguments against the tax are specious and, more than that, dangerous to the nation&#8217;s future should  massive, untaxed transfers of wealth to people who haven&#8217;t earned a dime of it become the law of the land.)</p>
<p>The Journal&#8217;s editorial page has <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123846422014872229.html">called the estate tax a &#8220;death tax&#8221;</a> for years, in keeping with its wealth-equals-good stance on just about all issues. Moving this language to the news pages is a sign that the newspaper is taking on a more overt world view &#8212; a view that takes its lead from the truth-be-damned ideologues on the editorial page.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t mind that the Journal is doing this, though I suspect more than a few of the journalists who write for the paper must be having major qualms. In fact, it strikes me as healthy that the paper is showing its world view in such a deliberate way.</p>
<p>There are risks for News Corp. in taking this stance, not least a repeat of the self-marginalization that Fox &#8220;News&#8221; has chosen with its incessant BS, to the point that no one who cares about honest journalism has much respect for the channel. Fox has thrown away any reputation it might have had for being even remotely interested in contrary facts, because even its supposed straight news reporting so often takes a political stance and the lies of the commentators are so astonishingly in-your-face.</p>
<p>The greater risk, in the short run, is whether the Journal&#8217;s journalists will let themselves be turned into propagandists. This need not be the case.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://telegraph.co.uk">Telegraph</a> in London has a right-of-center view of the world, proudly so, even in its news pages. But its journalism is generally excellent, rarely (from my reading, at any rate) propaganda. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m all for the Wall Street Journal turning itself into an American equivalent of the Telegraph: a responsible news organization with a transparent world view. But should the Journal turn itself into a newspaper/Web version of its Fox TV channel, it will be making a fatal mistake in the long run.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>UPDATED</p>
<p>More than 14 months after running <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/10/09/AR2009100903860.html">an editorial</a> with an egregious factual error, the Washington Post has yet to correct or explain its mistake.</p>
<p>Recapping from an earlier item here: The Post suggested that the Nobel Peace Prize that went to President Obama should have been awarded instead to Neda Agha-Soltan, an Iranian woman who was shot and killed during the post-election protests earlier in Iran this year.</p>
<p>The Post failed to do its homework, as the Atlantic&#8217;s James Fallows noted in detail (<a href="http://jamesfallows.theatlantic.com/archives/2009/10/dont_these_people_have_the_goo.php">here</a>, <a href="http://jamesfallows.theatlantic.com/archives/2009/10/the_speech_obama_wont.php">here</a>). The Nobel Peace Prize rules are clear: The only time it can be awarded after death is when the honoree had already been named &#8220;but who had died before he/she could receive the Prize on December 10.&#8221;</p>
<p>An editorial page concerned with accuracy would correct such a mistake. The Post, despite knowing about this, has not. Draw your own conclusion.</p>
<p>UPDATE: Still uncorrected as of February 9, 2011.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>UPDATED</p>
<blockquote><p>Arizona Republic (10/09/2009): <a href="http://www.azcentral.com/business/news/articles/2009/10/09/20091009BIZ-psychiceconomy1008.html">More turning to psychics for economic advice</a>. <em>When the going gets tough, Valley residents apparently go in search of the metaphysical. Local psychics and astrologers say that while they&#8217;re seeing some decline in business as longtime clients cut back on discretionary spending, the recession is bringing them many new customers.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Even though it&#8217;s shrinking along with all metropolitan newspapers in America, the Arizona Republic remains by far the biggest news organization in Phoenix and the state of Arizona. It still helps set the agenda for public discourse, and claims to be a responsible operation.</p>
<p>The story quoted above, which ran on the front of its local/state section, demonstrates serious irresponsibility on the part of the newspaper. It&#8217;s a textbook example of why smart readers are tuning out the press.</p>
<p>Consider the way the story starts. The word &#8220;apparently&#8221; is a tip-off that the piece is based on no actual data. Who&#8217;s the source for this alleged mini-flood of new customers? Why, the people selling the product. Makes sense to me: In I-can-see-into-the-future territory, we can just take their word for it.</p>
<p>Not a single customer is quoted. We hear only from the people who are claiming to be getting this influx of new customers. Can&#8217;t the newspaper find even one client?</p>
<p>Look. Newspapers run astrology columns &#8212; something I&#8217;d ban if I ran a paper, because I&#8217;m old-fashioned &#8212; with no disclaimers that there is no scientific basis for what these planet- and star-gazers tell us. But the astrology columns run, typically, near the comics, which is the fiction section of the daily paper.</p>
<p>No newspaper, as far as I know, gives its pages over to self-described psychics. Yet the Republic&#8217;s story quotes several, along with the astrologers, with a straight face.</p>
<p>It even provides a helpful sidebar explaining the difference between psychics, astrologers, fortune-tellers and mediums (in each case with the same level of &#8220;here&#8217;s what they say, never mind what science says&#8221; logic). For example, we learn that a psychic is &#8220;sensitive to non-physical or supernatural forces and influences, able to see into the future and into the events in a person&#8217;s life. Often uses tools such as tarot cards, crystals or tea leaves.&#8221; Gosh, thanks the the deeper insight.</p>
<p>I have to note that journalists spent much of the last decade quoting with a straight face the people from the financial and real estate industries who sold inflated goods to suckers, pulling big fees from the transactions. (Note: I do not indict the entire industry. I have a financial advisor who works for one of the big banks, an old and close friend who&#8217;s never, ever steered me toward something that was aimed at enriching him, and someone who&#8217;s comfortable with my tendency to buy and hold.)</p>
<p>The peddlers got rich, and then disclaimed culpability for the bubble or the financial catastrophe it spawned for those average folks (many of whom, we should noted, played the markets like insane gamblers who lose their kids&#8217; college money at Las Vegas casinos). Maybe a responsible story would have contrasted the slimy advice from the past with the advice people now seek &#8212; foolishly, in my view &#8212; from the self-professed seers.</p>
<p>Had this story appeared on April 1, I&#8217;d have applauded the piece as droll satire. Running with scarcely a hint of reality, it only satirizes the condition of the newspaper industry, or at least this corner of the trade.</p>
<p><em>(Note: The updates to this include some or all of the 3rd, 4th 7th and 8th paragraphs. Also please understand that the post update will make some of the earlier comments feel out of place.

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><em>(Note: These are first impressions, and I&#8217;ll be updating this posting.)<br />
</em></p>
<p>The Federal Trade Commission noticed a while back that marketers of brands, products and ideas have used new media in some incredibly dishonest ways. These include paying people or giving them freebies in return for positive mentions and not requiring (or even encouraging) them to disclose that they&#8217;re being compensated.</p>
<p>So with laudable goals, the commission issued a <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/os/2009/10/091005endorsementguidesfnnotice.pdf"/a">document</a> (390k pdf) aimed at better disclosure &#8212; with penalties of up to $11,000 in fines for violations. Basically, the FTC is saying that if you have a &#8220;material connection&#8221; to a product or service you&#8217;re praising, you are an endorser who must disclose that connection.</p>
<p>Sounds good, doesn&#8217;t it. But when you read the FTC&#8217;s ruling, published today, you get the sense of a government-gone-wild travesty. Why?</p>
<p>First, the new system is unworkable in practice, which is bad enough. Worse, the rules are worryingly vague and wide-ranging. Worse yet, they appear to give traditional print and broadcast journalists a pass while applying harsh regulations to bloggers (and others using conversational media of various kinds). Worst and most important, they are, in the end, an attack on markets and free speech, based on a 20th Century notion of media and advertising that simply doesn&#8217;t map to the new era.</p>
<p>The advertising of the past was a one-to-many system. Call it broadcasting. The Internet is a many-to-many system. Call that conversation. <em>They are not the same.</em></p>
<p>The FTC would deal with this essentially by throwing sand into the gears of online conversations. The rules are explained through examples &#8212; which means that almost no one can be sure that what he or she is doing, at least at the margins, is allowed or forbidden.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an example of the practical unworkability of what the FTC demands.</p>
<p>I disclose my various affiliations with companies when I do blog posts relating to them (or at least I try; I don&#8217;t doubt that I&#8217;ve forgotten to do this from time to time). And I have a long &#8220;<a href="http://dangillmor.com/about">About</a>&#8221; page that includes my various financial and other interests. That page notes, among other things, that Google has loaned me a bunch of Android phones to use with students for experiments.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve posted a number of Twitter tweets about Android, including my preference for that environment than Apple&#8217;s restricted system. Where, exactly &#8212; in a post with a total length of 140 characters &#8212; should the disclosure go? Has the FTC, for all practical purposes, just forbidden all positive comments about products and services on Twitter when the person doing the posting has a relationship of any kind with the company? Do I want to be the FTC&#8217;s guinea pig in a lawsuit where the world works this out?</p>
<p>And what about the extremely common practices of traditional media? Every news organization covering technology gets freebies by the container-load. Book reviewers&#8217; offices overflow with volumes sent by publishers. Subsidized or even complimentary travel, food and other things of this sort are common but too-rarely disclosed.</p>
<p>The answer is transparency. But do I want the feds enforcing it, especially when their rules can be interpreted narrowly or widely, depending on the circumstance?</p>
<p>Again, let&#8217;s be clear that the motives behind the FTC&#8217;s rules seem to be well-intentioned. I also loathe the odious practice of using bloggers and other online conversationalists as commercial sock puppets in a sleazy online word-of-mouth operation. Let&#8217;s also agree that disclosures are always better than hiding one&#8217;s affiliation with a company.</p>
<p>We already have laws against fraud. Let&#8217;s enforce those &#8212; first against the serious fraudsters, who keep getting away with it &#8212; before we even consider harsh regulations on speech.</p>
<p>We all want more transparency. I don&#8217;t see this as the right way to get it. </p>
<p>But I do predict one outcome of this FTC action: a slew of court cases. This is a full employment act for First Amendment lawyers, who have better things to do.</p>
<p>Note: Sam Bayard, assistant director of the <a href="http://citmedialaw.org">Citizen Media Law Project</a> at Harvard&#8217;s <a href="cyber.law.harvard.edu">Berkman Center for Internet and Society</a> (disclosure: I&#8217;m a co-founder of the project), corrected me on my initial language, in which I called today&#8217;s document &#8220;revised rules&#8221; from the FTC. He writes:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>They are non-binding guidelines meant to help advertisers, bloggers etc comply with the FTC Act:</em></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The Guides are administrative interpretations of the law intended to help advertisers comply with the Federal Trade Commission Act; they are not binding law themselves. In any law enforcement action challenging the allegedly deceptive use of testimonials or endorsements, the Commission would have the burden of proving that the challenged conduct violates the FTC Act.&#8221;  (from FTC <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2009/10/endortest.shtm">press release</a> today).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em><br />
As a matter of substance, you&#8217;re right that they will have much the same effect as rules because one would have to face an enforcement action  by the FTC to challenge them — not a pretty prospect at all. And their status as guidelines doesn&#8217;t lessen your concerns with practical workability, vagueness, and lopsidedness because the FTC will use them itself as guidelines for when to pursue investigations and bring enforcement actions.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ll be updating as I learn more. Meanwhile, for more reactions, take a look at some of these postings:</p>

My contribution to the early debate was a <a href="http://twitter.com/dangillmor/status/4401862016">Tweet</a> saying that I considered the move to be more proof &#8212; as if anyone needed it &#8212; that old-line print-journalism people have taken firm control of the Post&#8217;s news operation.</p>
<p>The paper&#8217;s ombudsman, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/linkset/2005/03/25/LI2005032500838.html">Andrew Alexander</a>, called yesterday. He&#8217;s looking into the situation, and wanted to chat further. I agreed that this deserves more than 140-character microblog posts. Here&#8217;s what I sent him this morning by email (expanded somewhat for even more nuance and to generalize beyond solely the Post&#8217;s interests):</p>
<p>From my perspective, this is a case of wanting to do the right thing in principle &#8212; assuring readers that the journalism they read is being done with the highest attention to honorable practices &#8212; but then getting it wrong in practice. While this isn&#8217;t a binary, yes/no question, it&#8217;s a also case where the principle collides with reality and, in my view, more compelling principles.</p>
<p>There are two issues, one immediate and practical and the other larger and more important, but also murkier.</p>
<p>The immediate one is to what extent the Post, or any other news organization that wants to be relevant in the Digital Age, should participate in social media. The Post seems to have taken the most restrictive possible position. As noted, I think that&#8217;s a mistake in a variety of ways.</p>
<p>The large<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rosedavies/110850792/"><img class="alignleft" style="border: 0pt none; margin: 3px;" src="http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/monkeys.jpg" border="0" alt="monkeys.jpg" width="192" height="111" align="left" /></a>r issue is transparency. I&#8217;ll come back to that, but it comes down to something that may sound counter-intuitive: So long as you do excellent journalism, greater transparency will lead readers to believe you less &#8212; that is, they&#8217;ll understand better why it&#8217;s impossible to get everything right all the time &#8212; but they&#8217;ll trust you more.</p>
<p>Others have done a much better job than I&#8217;ll attempt in deconstructing the memo that went out to the staff; Stowe Boyd&#8217;s <a href="http://www.stoweboyd.com/message/2009/09/shut-up.html">line-by-line analysis</a>, while more harsh than I&#8217;d have done, makes the essential points.</p>
<p>The editors&#8217; priestly-vows tone was only one reason some folks ridiculed it, however. So was what lots of us perceived as an unrealistic and ultimately damaging attempt to wall off journalists from participation in real life as a consequence of their work.</p>
<p>Any news organization contemplating such rules has to ask itself, and be prepared to answer, how far up the food chain the rules will travel. In the Post&#8217;s case, does this edict apply to Katharine Weymouth, CEO of Washington Post Media and publisher of the paper? To Don Graham, CEO of the parent company? To the advertising salespeople? To Andy Alexander?</p>
<p>The Post&#8217;s frown on social interaction has ramifications from the purely practical standpoint that social networks are central to tomorrow&#8217;s journalism. Journalism organizations have absolutely no alternative but to participate, in particular in the Post&#8217;s case because it&#8217;s as much a local newspaper, where conversation is core to the future, as a trade journal for the political class (the latter also has plenty of social networking potential).</p>
<p>The new policy misses that, but the paper still pretends to participate in social networks via semi-official accounts on Facebook, Twitter, et al. But social networks are about being social, and human voice is at the heart of online social interaction. Twitter posts from corporate entities are PR. They have no voice. Strip out voice, and there&#8217;s not much point in joining that conversation.</p>
<p>If the Post bosses are really serious about this, by the way, they&#8217;ll need to take it further. Consider this from the memo</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Post journalists must refrain from writing, tweeting or posting anything—including photographs or video—that could be perceived as reflecting political, racial, sexist, religious or other bias or favoritism that could be used to tarnish our journalistic credibility. This same caution should be used when joining, following or friending any person or organization online.<br />
</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Never mind the truly weird equating of racism with religious or political beliefs. I wouldn&#8217;t employ anyone who expressed racist views in any capacity, period.</p>
<p>The bigger problem with the policy, as quoted above, is that it only covers online social networks. It <em>doesn&#8217;t</em> cover the social network we all have in real life, namely our &#8220;analog&#8221; contacts with others.</p>
<p>New shut-up orders will surely have to be extended to social interactions at parties, won&#8217;t they? Given the increasing (and somewhat disturbing) possibility or even likelihood that someone may be collecting audio or video of what people in public life say or do in public, and given the fact that journalists are players in this public arena, isn&#8217;t it now necessary to prohibit journalists from expressing opinions in any setting except, perhaps, at work? (Ask Time magazine&#8217;s <a href="http://www.salon.com/opinion/greenwald/2009/09/01/klein/">Joe Klein</a> about this.)</p>
<p>If the Post extends the edict to offline encounters, at logically may have to, the rights of the employees start to sound like the ones at the CIA, which unlike the Post is not an organization that helps the people you serve have a vital conversation about public policy. But it&#8217;s inevitably where the paper will have to go if this policy sticks.</p>
<p>Which brings me back to the more important issue of transparency. I&#8217;m convinced that it will become one of journalism&#8217;s core principles in this new era, right up there with thoroughness, accuracy, fairness and independent thinking. It has to become part of the process, because without it people will have even less reason to trust what journalists do. It will be forced on some organizations that resist; the Post seems likely to be in that camp of resisters, at least for now, because the trend is largely in the wrong direction.</p>
<p>The paper is in good, or at least typical, company. The journalism craft has been almost entirely opaque during the monopoly/oligopoly era of media. Some of the reasons for this made sense, including the legal ones (though lawyers are always too cautious, because that&#8217;s their job). Apart from your column and the occasionally revealing remarks people make in the scheduled online chats, the Post is almost completely opaque.</p>
<p>Transparency takes several forms. I strongly believe that news organizations have a duty to explain to their audiences how they do their journalism, and why. Even the organizations that claim to have no world view should be telling people much more about the &#8220;how&#8221; &#8212; though too few do &#8212; because they&#8217;d help readers/viewers/listeners/etc. understand what it takes to do good journalism, assuming they actually do good journalism. It baffles me that an industry that wants to be perceived as better than the newcomers to the craft doesn&#8217;t grasp this, but it clearly doesn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>The &#8220;why&#8221; is more nuanced, especially for big organizations (at least in America). They could take a page from the newcomers.</p>
<p>The best journalistic bloggers are much more open on this; their world views and motivations are typically crystal clear. And their audiences, even people who disagree with those world views, can refract their own understanding of the topics through those lenses.</p>
<p>The response I get when I say these things is typically along these lines: But if journalists say what they think, they&#8217;ll call into question their objectivity. I <a href="http://dangillmor.typepad.com/dan_gillmor_on_grassroots/2005/01/the_end_of_obje.html">don&#8217;t believe in objectivity</a> in the first place. And the public already perceives journalists to be biased, which of course they are &#8212; though I don&#8217;t believe this is the same as unethical.</p>
<p>I wish that U.S. news organizations would drop the pretense of being impartial and having no world view. There&#8217;s no conflict between having a world view and doing great journalism.</p>
<p>When I go to London I buy the Guardian and the Telegraph. Both do excellent journalism. The <a href="http://guardian.co.uk">Guardian</a> covers the world from a slightly left-of-center standpoint, and the <a href="http://telegraph.co.uk">Telegraph</a> from a slightly right-of-center stance. I read both and figure I&#8217;m triangulating on the essence of (British establishment) reality. Even if I read just one, the paper&#8217;s overt frame of reference gives me a better way to understand what&#8217;s happening than if it pretended to be impartial. And &#8212; crucially &#8212; both of them run articles (and lots of op-eds) that either directly challenge their world views or, more routinely, include facts and context that runs contrary to what the editors and proprietors might wish was true. Relentless journalism&#8217;s independence of thought means, in particular, being willing or even eager to learn why your core assumptions could be wrong.</p>
<p>The Post had a profoundly obvious world view during the run-up to the Iraq War: pro-administration, pro-war &#8212; and it was reflected principally in the fact that the little journalism it did questioning the war rarely if ever made the front page, as opposed to relentless parroting of war-mongering from Bush administration insiders. The evidence is overwhelming, and even Post journalists have <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A58127-2004Aug11?language=printer">admitted</a> as much, though not in those precise words. I&#8217;m guessing that the newspaper&#8217;s editors, who can be as good as (or better than) anyone else in the field, would have done a better job of covering the opposing views (and facts) if the paper&#8217;s world view had been stated as a matter of policy, partly because the best journalists enjoy challenging conventional wisdom even when it&#8217;s from their own bosses.</p>
<p>When it comes to individual views and specifics about individual reporters and editors, I grant that this does get a bit more tricky. I&#8217;m not suggesting that the Post or anyone else put reporters&#8217; tax returns online. But I would suggest that when something they are, or believe, might be relevant to a reader that it&#8217;s OK, and maybe important, to let the reader know. (A religion reporters&#8217; faith, as in what religion or sect he follows (or absence of faith, for that matter) seems relevant to me.)</p>
<p>And I&#8217;d strongly suggest that while a random opinion or quip might be bothersome, letting journalists be human beings would have a better outcome in the end. Telling staff to hide all opinions doesn&#8217;t cause readers to trust you more. It tells them you&#8217;re hiding something, because they aren&#8217;t stupid.</p>
<p>The principle behind the Post&#8217;s social media policy is based on instincts derived from the 20th century monopoly/oligopoly business model. The wishful thinking it represents is unfortunate. It&#8217;s not going to work in the end, and in the meantime one of the world&#8217;s great news organizations will be losing ground that will be harder and harder to make up.</p>

		<p><span><object height="170" width="280"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/Xy9P8-cCvjE&#038;hl=en&#038;fs=1&#038;" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/Xy9P8-cCvjE&#038;hl=en&#038;fs=1&#038;" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" height="170" align="center" width="280"></embed></object></span><br />In a <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Remarks-by-the-President-in-Discussion-with-9th-Graders-Wakefield-High-School/">Q&#038;A on Tuesday</a> at Wakefield High School in Arlington, Virginia, President Obama cautioned a group of 9th graders to be careful of what they post online. He was too cautious by half.</p>
<p>The question was from a student who wanted to be president some day and asked for advice on career paths. According to the White House transcript, he said, in the first of what he called &#8220;practical tips&#8221; for ambitious young people:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I want everybody here to be careful about what you post on Facebook &#8212; because in the YouTube age, whatever you do, it will be pulled up again later somewhere in your life. And when you&#8217;re young, you make mistakes and you do some stupid stuff. And I&#8217;ve been hearing a lot about young people who &#8212; you know, they&#8217;re posting stuff on Facebook, and then suddenly they go apply for a job and somebody has done a search and &#8212; so that&#8217;s some practical political advice for you right there. </em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The president may have been right about this in today&#8217;s world. I hope he&#8217;s wrong in tomorrow&#8217;s. Let&#8217;s unpack what he said to see why.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s absolutely true that young people make mistakes and do stupid things. Anyone who <em>doesn&#8217;t</em> commit youthful stupidities is either inhuman or stunningly boring and inconsequential. Who wants someone like that to be in charge of anything as an adult? Not me.</p>
<p>But it doesn&#8217;t follow, as the president suggested, that posting weird (to older people) things on the Web &#8212; in blogs, social networks and the like &#8212; should be an automatic turnoff or disqualification for a responsible job later on. The notion of punishing someone decades later for what he or she said or did as a teenager or college student just feels wrong to me.</p>
<p>A journalism student where I teach recently asked if it was advisable to have a personal blog or, if so, to be outspoken on it. He&#8217;d apparently been warned that it could put a crimp in his future journalism career plans.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t say how others would react. I do know that if I were hiring someone today I&#8217;d want to know what (not if) he or she posted online, not to find disqualifying factors but to see if this is an interesting person. I&#8217;d take for granted that I might find some things that were risque or inappropriate for my current world. I&#8217;d expect to find things that would be &#8220;unjournalistic&#8221; in some ways, such as outspoken or foolish (or both) views on important people and issues. But I&#8217;d also remember my own ability, if not tendency, to be an idiot when I was that age. And I&#8217;d discount appropriately.</p>
<p>This is all about giving people what my friend Esther Dyson has called a &#8220;statute of limitations on stupidity.&#8221; If we don&#8217;t all start cutting each other more slack in this increasingly transparent (often by our own choice) society, we&#8217;ll only allow drones into positions of authority. Now that&#8217;s really scary.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re making progress, probably more than Obama gives us credit for. Recall that it was impossible for a Catholic to be president, until John F. Kennedy was elected. It was impossible for a divorced person to be elected until Ronald Reagan won. It was impossible for a former pot smoker to be president until Bill Clinton (who bizarrely claimed not to have inhaled) got elected. And so on. </p>
<p>How we make these judgements is neither clear nor simple. Robert McDonnell, a candidate for governor in Virginia, is <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/09/02/AR2009090203444.html?hpid=topnews">taking hits</a> for a 20-year-old master&#8217;s thesis in which he denounced programs that encouraged women to work outside the home and said working women were bad for families. He wants voters to ignore all this and concentrate on what he says are his positions now.</p>
<p>McDonnell deserves some slack, too, but he wrote the thesis when he was in his mid-30s, not his early 20s or younger. His record as a legislator since then has been extremely conservative, as well. What he said two decades ago is obviously more relevant, given the circumstances, than what a student posts on a high-school Facebook page today.</p>
<p>In the foreseeable future, we&#8217;ll elect a president who had blog or Facebook wall or MySpace page when she was a teenager and college student. By the standards of today she&#8217;ll be utterly disqualified for any serious political job. But because we&#8217;ll have grown as a society, not just more tolerant of flaws but understanding that we all have feet of clay in some respect, we&#8217;ll elect her anyway, because we&#8217;ll realize that the person she became &#8212; and how that happened &#8212; is what counts.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p style="clear: both"><a class="image-link" href="http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/president_education_talk-full.png"><img class="linked-to-original" style=" display: inline; float: left; margin: 0 10px 10px 0;" src="http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/president_education_talk-thumb1.png" alt="" width="250" height="174" align="left" /></a>It&#8217;s easy, and appropriate, to feel gloom mixed with contempt at the way some right-wing flamethrowers, abetted by mass media&#8217;s love of conflict, have turned President Obama&#8217;s <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/MediaResources/PreparedSchoolRemarks/">webcast to the nation&#8217;s schoolchildren</a> into a new socialist manifesto. They cherry-picked an innocuous idea from a lesson plan &#8212; the president asking kids to help him do his job better &#8212; and claimed it was radical ideology.</p>
<p style="clear: both">
<p style="clear: both">
<div>So they&#8217;ve persuaded quite a few districts to either not show it or ask parents&#8217; permission. The administrators in those districts have put on a fine demonstration of cowardice. But that is, let&#8217;s be fair, what it takes to run a school system in much of America today, where the worst sin seems to be teaching children how to think for themselves.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the lost opportunity in the Obama talk. Teachers and administrators in the districts that have banned the webcast could have used it in ways that would have put their fear into context. They could have shown it to students and then had a conversation about it.</p></div>
<p style="clear: both">
<p style="clear: both">The Obama critics do have one thing right, though they don&#8217;t seem clear on the concept. They&#8217;re skeptical of what people in authority say. In this case skepticism has morphed into paranoia, as they claim children watching the talk could be indoctrinated by an authority figure who, in their view, is wrong on policy and morality.</p>
<p style="clear: both">Attempting to prevent children from hearing the president&#8217;s words is not just foolish, but counterproductive. I&#8217;m betting this has backfired, given kids&#8217; tendency to seek out what adults tell them to stay away from.</p>
<p style="clear: both">
<p style="clear: both">
<div>Had the fearful administrators chosen to do their jobs, they would have used this speech in at least four ways. They could have shown it and then asked teachers to ask students to to analyze a) what the president had said; b) how he said it; c) how the White House used the media of the day to get his words to the people he wanted to reach; and d) how other media handled the controversy. (They could have done worse than to use the suggested <a href="http://www.ed.gov/teachers/how/lessons/prek-6.pdf">classroom</a> <a href="http://www.ed.gov/teachers/how/lessons/7-12.pdf">activities</a> (PDFs) related to the talk. And I hope that districts where people generally support Obama would also take the opportunity to address these questions.)</div>
<p style="clear: both">
<p style="clear: both">
<div>Buried deep in the Obama address is a single reference to critical thinking, where he refers to &#8220;the insights and critical thinking skills you gain in history and social studies to fight poverty and homelessness, crime and discrimination, and make our nation more fair and more free.&#8221; But are kids really gaining such skills and insights? Not enough, that&#8217;s clear, but sometimes subtlety invades even the most brazen attempts to keep reality away from people.</div>
<p style="clear: both">
<div>The ongoing efforts to to insert religion into science instruction &#8212; essentially insisting that biblical creationism be offered as an &#8220;alternative theory&#8221; to evolution &#8212; are deeply ironic in this context. It&#8217;s one thing to be skeptical, an essential part of critical thinking. It&#8217;s another to turn biology class into Bible study. Yet to the extent that the creationists succeed in this campaign, they are also telling kids to question authority.</div>
<p style="clear: both">
<div>Critical thinking is very much about questioning authority, but not to extremes. It&#8217;s not about disowning the evidence, but rather using it, including information from sources we&#8217;ve come to trust, to make our own decisions. Sometimes we&#8217;ll decide badly. That&#8217;s part of life.</div>
<p style="clear: both">
<div>We&#8217;d decide better if we had better journalism. And this entire mess has featured the too-common substandard variety. Perhaps the people most deserving of contempt in this entire episode are the ones running traditional media organizations that have again abdicated their duty by focusing on the political fighting instead of the serious issues. Even in their coverage of the battles, they&#8217;ve resorted for the most part to the standard stenographic technique of quoting &#8220;both sides&#8221; despite the way one side has been overwhelmingly dishonest.</div>
<p style="clear: both">
<div>David Carr, in his column in yesterday&#8217;s New York Times, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/07/business/media/07carr.html?scp=2&amp;sq=david%20carr&amp;st=cse">took a shot</a> at the problem. He hit the target but missed the bulls-eye. Here&#8217;s an extended quote:</div>
<blockquote style="clear: both"><p><em>The administration seems to believe that if all the information on a given issue is on the table — or in this case, on the Web — then the truth, or at least their version of it, will win out. (The president announced on Friday that with certain exceptions, the names of visitors to the White House would be posted for all to see). For all his modern impulses, President Obama’s press operation seems mired in a high school civics debate version of governance, where points are given for logic and argument.</em></p>
<p><em>That is not how the media works, however, in an environment that prizes engagement and conflict. The long town-hall process over health care, for example, has given ordinary citizens a voice but it has also produced hundreds of video clips of angry, scared Americans. For every aging secretary who can’t afford prescriptions, there is a small business owner who wants less government in their life, not more. Tropes like “death panels” may lack substance, but they make for pretty compelling viewing day after day.</em></p>
<p><em>In part, the outrage and hyperbole work because the mainstream media, insecure about their own status in an atomizing world, play into the tyranny of split-screen coverage where almost any claim — no matter how outlandish — becomes one side in “an interesting debate.” When not listening to talking heads, the traditional news outlets go to great efforts to get a microphone on vox populi. If the people, even if it is some unknown number, are hopping mad, we don’t want to be the last to tell you about it.<br />

<p style="clear: both">Bingo. Too bad Carr doesn&#8217;t take his own logic to a logical conclusion. He merely notes &#8220;how the media works&#8221; but doesn&#8217;t even suggest that journalists who cover these issues bear any responsibility for their preference to feed the lie machine instead of counter it. Oh, there have been a few stories pointing out the fundamental unreality on which the protests have been based, but vastly more on the protests themselves.</p>
<p style="clear: both">The most important concept, which Carr misses, is the one the media have abandoned in recent times: responsibility. Look again at the White House graphic at the top of this piece. The president is urging students &#8220;to take responsibility for their educations&#8221; because all the good teaching and parenting won&#8217;t be enough if the students themselves don&#8217;t care.</p>
<p style="clear: both">We share responsibility for knowing what we&#8217;re talking about. The traditional media&#8217;s unwillingness to help &#8212; part of its general collapse &#8212; means that, more and more, it&#8217;s up to the rest of us to figure things out for ourselves.</p>
