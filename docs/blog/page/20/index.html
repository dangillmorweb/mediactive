		<p>UPDATED</p>
<blockquote><p>NY Times Public Editor: <a href="http://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/02/17/the-olympics-dont-tell-me/?src=tptw">The Olympics? Don’t Tell Me</a>: <em>&#8220;‘Could you please ask the editor of the front Web page to not name the winners within the headlines/sub-headlines?’ asked Ken Waters of Phoenix.  Matt Gooch of Harrisonburg, Va. said he was disappointed when The Times reported the results of the men’s downhill before NBC showed the event.  ‘This is not Taliban news, nor TARP news, or even Paula Jones type news,’ Gooch said.  ‘There is no meaning to this except the anticipation and suspense that sports viewers feel watching the event live.  Please help me understand why your organization needs to spoil the experience.’&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p></blockquote>
<p>Good. Grief.</p>
<p>The fact that the ombudsman of the New York Times needs to explain to readers why his newspaper reports actual news as it happens &#8212; and Olympic results are actual news &#8212; is a depressing commentary on our nation&#8217;s entertainment-driven culture.</p>
<p>NBC bought U.S. TV rights to the Olympics, and NBC has chosen not to present live coverage. It wants to put the high-profile events on at night in the U.S. when it can score the biggest audience. It&#8217;s entirely about money, as the Olympics are in a general sense at this point.</p>
<p>But to suggest that real news organizations should defer to NBC&#8217;s greed is beyond idiotic. It&#8217;s pathetic.</p>
<p>Mr. Waters of Phoenix and Mr. Gooch of Harrisonburg, and others like them, need remedial education in at least three respects. First, they need to understand that news organizations are in business to report news. Second, no one is forcing them to look at the Times website in the first place.</p>
<p>And, third, remember: <em>The spoiler here is NBC</em>, which wants you to live in a fantasy world. Blame the entertainment moguls there, not real journalists, if you learn who won an event before NBC deigns to show it on TV.</p>
<p>Any news organization holding back on news because entertainment consumers want to live in their fantasy worlds deserves utter contempt. As a (very small) shareholder in the New York Times Co., I&#8217;m glad to see that America&#8217;s best newspaper has the right standards in this regard.</p>
<p>UPDATE: Several commenters have defended the notion that news organizations have some kind of duty to hold back their reports or put reports on pages where news viewers won&#8217;t have to see the reports. One commenter, who says he&#8217;s a journalism school graduate, even <a href="http://mediactive.com/2010/02/17/there-are-no-spoilers-in-news/#comment-1312">suggested a &#8220;civic function&#8221;</a> in such a method. This is head-slappingly strange logic (as I responded):</p>
<p>To suggest there’s some kind of civic function in asking news  organizations to withhold breaking news of an entertainment event (I  agree the Olympics are entertainment more than anything else) is  bizarre. There is no civic value in two corporate media giants colluding  to help one of them make enough money to justify its overpayment for TV  rights. NBC has absolutely no interest in performing a civic function;  its entire motivation is the bottom line.</p>
<p>Your idea of “timeliness” is equally odd. No one is preventing you  from structuring your news the way you want to. If you prefer not to  learn about news events until later in the day, or tomorrow or next  week, you have an easy way of doing this: Don’t read, listen to or watch  news reports until you’re ready to learn what’s happened. You will also  need to stay away from the water cooler and conversations with friends  and colleagues who don’t share your desire to learn about the outcome of  ski races only when a giant media corporation deems it most profitable.</p>
<p>I watched the skiing last night on NBC. The network severely edited  the race, ignoring the runs of roughly half of the top seed (first 15  racers) because the women crashed or were otherwise deemed uninteresting  to the American audience by the NBC entertainment editors. It inserted a  vast number of commercials into what little of the event it decided to  broadcast. This is the civic virtue you want to reward? Please.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><em>(Here&#8217;s another excerpt from my upcoming book.)</em></p>
<p>Throughout my print-journalism career, I worked hard to stay at the edges of organization charts—the lower edges. I had opportunities to run several publications, but in the end I decided that my best role at the time was reporting, writing and (as a columnist) being an advocate. I admire many of the editors I’ve known, and have had some great bosses. But I’ve steered clear of the hiring and firing role, and—though I ran the business affairs of a group of musicians in an earlier career—I never had to make a payroll in the print media business.</p>
<p>Most traditional journalists have also been insulated from the business side of journalism, but not because they’ve chosen to steer clear of it—others have steered them away. Management requires them to keep away from the advertising department, as if they’d get a terminal disease if they had much contact. </p>
<p>This separation of church and state, as we journalists called it with such hubris, came from good motives: not to allow the advertisers—the main customers of the newspaper, if the people who supply the most revenues are the main customers—to dictate or, allegedly, even influence news coverage. This separation was always something of a fiction, given publishers’ and broadcasting station managers’ business duties and influence over the people who worked for them, but it did serve a purpose.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, ivory-tower isolation had more than one downside. In particular, it served, especially during the monopoly and oligopoly decades, to insulate journalists from any semblance of reality about the industries in which they worked. So when the financial underpinnings started getting shaky, more than a decade ago, the journalists were too willing cover their eyes and ears and pretend nothing was wrong. And, later, when reality arrived, layoffs and staff buyouts gathered momentum, and news organizations started getting sold to even greedier owners, the journalists suspended belief as the new owners promised they had “no plans” for further cutbacks.</p>
<p>My experiences on the business side of life, both early in my adulthood and more recently as co-founder of a failed startup, investor, and co-founder of a successful startup, persuade me that one of 20th century pro journalism’s cardinal flaws has been the church-state wall. By all means, tell advertisers (and mean it) that they don’t run the news operations. But a journalist who has no idea how his industry really works from a business perspective is missing way too much of the big picture.</p>
<p>If I ran a news organization today (or a <a href="http://mediactive.com/2010/02/02/the-future-of-journalism-education/">journalism school</a>), I’d insist that the journalists understood, appreciated and embraced the new arena we all inhabit—and that emphatically includes how business works. They’d understand the variety of financial models that support media, especially the organization they worked for, and would be versed in the lingo of CPM, SEO, and the like. I would not ask journalists to grub for the most page views, a new trend that tends to bring out the worst in media, but would very much want them to know what was happening in all parts of their enterprise, not just the content area.</p>

		<p><em>Keeping in spirit, I&#8217;m producing this post on my G1, using the app described.</em></p>
<p>The new <a href="http://android.wordpress.org">WordPress app</a> for Android has been released and it&#8217;s quite nice. While blogging from a phone still feels a bit limited, this app is a good option for blogging away from a machine.</p>
<p>The application integrates with self-hosted blogs and features tabs for managing comments, posts and pages. The screen for writing posts integrates with Android&#8217;s image gallery. (Here, it becomes an even greater travesty that Android doesn&#8217;t provide an easy way to take screenshots.) Once written, posts can be published or uploaded as drafts. </p>
<p>Also nice is the comment alert feature, allowing the user to get updates when new comments show up. If you require comment approval for new posters, this can free you from your machine and frequent dashboard refreshes.</p>
<p>In all, it&#8217;s nice to see this app taken seriously with bases well-covered in its initial version.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><em>Next week I&#8217;ll be attending a <a href="http://www.paleycenter.org/mc-news-frontier-2">one-day conference</a> at the <a href="http://www.paleycenter.org/">Paley Center for Media</a> in New York. The center and the <a href="http://carnegie.org/">Carnegie Corp.</a> are asking what the future of journalism education should be &#8212; who should do it, how it should be done, and for what purpose.</em></p>
<p><em>I&#8217;ve been thinking about this for some time, and have blogged a number of ideas in the past several years, and one chapter in my upcoming book, Mediactive, will look closely at media education. Here&#8217;s an excerpt:</em></p>
<p><em> </em>If I ran a journalism school, I would start with the same <a href="http://mediactive.com/principles/">basic principles</a> of honorable, high-quality journalism and mediactivism, and embed them at the core of everything else. If our students didn’t understand and appreciate them, nothing else we did would matter very much.</p>
<p>With the principles as the foundation, I would, among many other things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Emphasize undergraduate journalism degrees as great liberal arts programs, even more valuable that way than as training for journalism careers. At the same time, focus graduate journalism studies on helping people with expertise in specific areas to be the best possible journalists in their fields.</li>
<li>Do away with the still-common “track” system for would-be journalists where students focus on print, broadcast, online, etc. These are merging. There would be one track. We wouldn’t just recognize our students’ digital future; we’d immerse them in it.</li>
<li>Encourage, and require in some cases, cross-disciplinary learning and doing. We’d create partnerships around the university, working with business, engineering/computer science, film, political science, law, design and many other programs. The goals would be both to develop our own projects and to be an essential community-wide resource for the future of local media.</li>
<li>Teach students not just the basics of digital media but also the value of data and programming to their future work. This doesn’t necessarily mean that they need to become programmers; but they absolutely need to know how to communicate with programmers. We’d also encourage computer science undergraduates to become journalism graduate students, so they can help create tomorrow’s media.</li>
<li>Require all students to learn basic statistics, survey research and fundamental scientific methodology. The inability of journalists to understand what they’re reading is one of journalism’s &#8212; and society’s &#8212; major flaws.</li>
<li>Encourage a research agenda with deep connections to key media issues of today. More than ever, we need solid data and rigorous analysis. And translate faculty research into language average people can understand as opposed to the dense, even impenetrable, prose that’s clear (if it really is) only to readers of academic journals.</li>
<li>Require all journalism students to understand business concepts, especially those relating to media. This is not just to cure the longstanding ignorance of business issues in the craft, but also to recognize that today’s students will be among the people who develop tomorrow’s journalism business models. We’d discuss for-profit and not-for-profit methods, and look at advertising, marketing, social networking, and search-engine optimization, among many other elements.</li>
<li>Make entrepreneurship a core part of journalism education. <a href="http://cronkite.asu.edu">Arizona State University</a>, where I’m working, is among several schools working on this, and the early experiments are gratifying. Several of our student projects have won funding. At City University of New York, Jeff Jarvis has received foundation <a href="http://entrepreneurialjourno.pbworks.com/cuny">funding for student projects</a> to continue after the class is over, based on semester-ending competitive “pitches” to a judging panel of journalists and investors. We need to see more and more of these and other kinds of experiments.</li>
<li>Recognize that not all, and probably not most, students will end up as entrepreneurs. But they will all come to appreciate two key elements of entrepreneurship. One is the notion of taking ownership of a process and outcome. The other, which may be the most important single thing students &#8212; of all kinds &#8212; need in this fast-changing world is an appreciation of ambiguity, and the ability to deal with it. This means reacting to changes around us, being flexible and swift when circumstances change. Ambiguity is not something to fear; it is part of our lives, and we need to embrace it.</li>
<li>In a related area, recognize that many of our best students, particularly the ones with a genuine entrepreneurial bent, will not graduate as scheduled, if ever. They’ll create or join startups while they have the passion and energy, and we should encourage them to try.</li>
<li>Appreciate our graduates no matter where their careers have taken them. If we understand that journalism education is a valuable step into any number of professions, we should not just celebrate the graduates who’ve gone on to fame (if not fortune) in journalism, but also those who’ve made marks in other fields.</li>
<li>Persuade the president (or chancellor or whatever the title) and trustees of the university that every student on the campus should learn journalism principles and skills before graduating, preferably during freshman year. At State University of New York’s Stony Book campus, the journalism school has been given a special mandate of exactly this kind. Howard Schneider, a former newspaper journalist who now is dean of Stony Brook’s journalism school, won foundation funding to bring <a href="http://www.stonybrook.edu/journalism/cfnlindex.shtml">news literacy</a> into the university’s broader community, not just those enrolled in journalism courses.</li>
<li>Create a program of the same kind for people in the community, starting with teachers. Our goal would be to help schools across our geographical area bring mediactivism to every level of education—not just college, but also grade, middle, and high school. We would offer workshops, conferences and online training.</li>
<li>Offer that program, or one like it, to concerned parents who feel overwhelmed by the media deluge themselves, to help turn them into better media consumers and to give them ways to help their children.</li>
<li>Keep what we now call public relations as part of the mission, but move it into a separate program. Call it “Persuasion,” and include marketing and other kinds of non-journalistic advocacy in this category. As we recognize that the lines are blurring, sometimes uncomfortably, we’ll require all journalism students to learn the techniques of persuasion. But Persuasion majors would conversely be steeped in the principles of honorable media creation.</li>
<li>Provide for-fee training to communicators who work in major local institutions, such as PR and marketing folks from private companies, governmental organizations, and others. If they could be persuaded that the principles matter, they might offer the public less BS and more reality, and we’d all be better off for the exercise.</li>
<li>Enlist another vital player in the effort to help people appreciate the value of solid, ethical journalism: local media of all kinds, not just traditional media. Of course, as noted earlier, they should be making this a core part of their missions, given that their own credibility would rise if they helped people understand the principles and process of quality journalism. But we’d very much want to work with local new media organizations and individuals, too.</li>
<li>Advise and train citizen journalists to understand and apply the principles and best practices. They are going to be an essential part of the local journalism ecosystem, and we should reach out to show them how we can help.</li>
<li>Augment local media with our own journalism. We train students to do journalism, after all, and their work should be widely available in the community, particularly when it fills in gaps left by the shrinking traditional media. At Arizona State, the <a href="http://cronkitenews.asu.edu">Cronkite News Service</a> provides all kinds of coverage of topics the local news organizations rarely cover, making our students’ work available to those organizations. Soon, we’ll be publishing it ourselves on our own website.</li>
</ul>
<p>All this suggests a considerably broader mission for journalism schools and programs than the one they’ve had in the past. It also suggests a huge opportunity for journalism schools. The need for this kind of training has never been greater. We’re not the only ones who can do it, but we may be among the best equipped.</p>
<p><em>Note: Seth Lewis at the Nieman Journalism Lab is <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2010/02/what-is-journalism-school-for-a-call-for-input/">looking for ideas</a> in this space. He&#8217;s dead-on in wanting to see students come out of the experience with great flexibility, and his piece has already attracted some excellent comments.</em></p>

		<p>Alan Rusbridger, editor of the Guardian, has published a lecture he gave this week. He asks, &#8220;<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2010/jan/25/cudlipp-lecture-alan-rusbridger">Does journalism exist?</a>&#8221; &#8212; and his answers, as you&#8217;d expect, are a must-read for anyone who cares about the future of journalism.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m tempted to quote from pieces of his talk. But it&#8217;s so meaty that I want to encourage you to take the time to read it for yourself. The lecture ranges widely &#8212; including the question of who&#8217;ll actually pay for information in the future. </p>
<p>When you&#8217;re done reading it, you&#8217;ll understand better why the organization Alan leads has deservedly become one of the most widely followed news sites in the English language.</p>

		<h2 class="entry-title"><a href="http://mediactive.com/2010/01/22/how-to-set-up-your-own-paywall-with-drop-io/" rel="bookmark">How to Set Up Your Own Paywall with drop.io</a></h2>	</header><!-- .entry-header -->

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><em>Update: Drop.io&#8217;s technology was <a href="http://blog.drop.io/2010/10/29/an-important-update-on-the-future-of-drop-io/" target="_blank">acquired</a> by Facebook in October 2010 and the site was discontinued as it was. I&#8217;ll be hunting for site&#8217;s that offer a similar approach to easily upload content on the fly and charge users for access to it. If you run across anything on your own, please send it our way.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://drop.io"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1215" title="dropio1" src="http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/dropio1.jpg" alt="drop.io logo" width="93" height="30" /></a>With the discussion over the New York Times&#8217; paywall plans this week, I thought it would be interesting to explore how an individual could set up her own paywall. This isn&#8217;t to make a call either way on whether a paywall is good or bad business, but individual experiments in this area could yield interesting results.</p>
<p>While there are multiple ways to host and charge for content online, <a href="http://drop.io">drop.io</a> offers a fairly simple option. Drop.io is a collaborative, file-sharing service that becomes interesting when you add its privacy options and real-time nature. In addition to file-sharing, drop.io offers the user a feature (appropriately named Paywall) to charge for uploaded content.</p>
<p>Many kinds of media creators can find benefit in a streamlined system for charging for files. Drop.io offers several <a href="http://drop.io/paywalldemo">use cases</a>, which include the independent journalist who wants to charge for monthly access to an insider news service and the photographer who wants to sell high-resolution versions of his images. To this, I also see usefulness to the data journalist who wants to fund her document digging and visualization time by charging for curated data sets. As well, this could be an option for quickly selling that newsworthy photo you caught at the right place at the right time.</p>
<p>Drop.io has a thorough and well-done <a href="http://drop.io/paywallinstructions">how-to</a> on their site, but I&#8217;ll give the steps in broad strokes here:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Create a new drop on drop.io&#8217;s homepage.</strong> You have the option to add a file in this step and you&#8217;ll have to create an admin password.<br />
<a href="http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/dropio_creating_a_drop.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1216" title="dropio_creating_a_drop" src="http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/dropio_creating_a_drop.jpg" alt="" width="427" height="333" srcset="http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/dropio_creating_a_drop.jpg 427w, http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/dropio_creating_a_drop-300x233.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 427px) 100vw, 427px" /></a></li>
<li><strong>Access Paywall and follow the setup instructions.</strong> This is done by appending your drop&#8217;s URL with &#8220;/admin/paywall/&#8221;.<br />
<a href="http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/dropio_paywall_setup2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1219" title="dropio_paywall_setup" src="http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/dropio_paywall_setup2.jpg" alt="" width="734" height="423" srcset="http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/dropio_paywall_setup2.jpg 734w, http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/dropio_paywall_setup2-300x172.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 734px) 100vw, 734px" /></a></li>
<li><strong>S</strong><strong>etup your Amazon Payments Business Account.</strong> Drop.io will take you to Amazon to set up a new account or you can use an existing one. One thing to note is that your Amazon Payments name will be visible to buyers. So, keep this in mind if there is a desire for anonymity/pseudonymity.<br />
<a href="http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/dropio_amazon_payments.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1220" title="dropio_amazon_payments" src="http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/dropio_amazon_payments-1023x360.jpg" alt="" width="614" height="216" srcset="http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/dropio_amazon_payments-1023x360.jpg 1023w, http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/dropio_amazon_payments-300x105.jpg 300w, http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/dropio_amazon_payments.jpg 1341w" sizes="(max-width: 614px) 100vw, 614px" /></a></li>
<li><strong>Finish by entering your Amazon Payments info and agreeing to terms.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>It&#8217;s important to note that each site will take a cut from transactions. Drop.io takes 1% and Amazon takes 1-3% and some change based on payment method. As well, free accounts on drop.io go up to 100mb, but it&#8217;s $20/month to upgrade to 10gb.</p>
<p>All in all, I believe the simplicity of this approach allows for fast experimentation in terms of the kind of content an individual can sell.  For example, <a href="http://paidcontent.org">PaidContent.org</a> began as a one-man trade <a href="http://www.wired.com/techbiz/media/news/2003/07/59603">newsletter</a> by Rafat Ali. As well, the system could fit into the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124094416078864595.html">1000 True Fans model</a> being adopted by entrepreneurial media creators. This is ripe for creativity.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Another not-for-profit news organization is launching soon &#8212; the <a href="http://www.bayareanewsproject.org/">Bay Area News Project</a>. It&#8217;s a worthy and important development in a metropolitan area that&#8217;s been watching (assuming that folks are actually paying attention) the slow-motion disintegration of newspaper journalism, and I&#8217;m a big fan of the founding editor, <a href="http://www.newwest.net/member/bio/1229/">Jonathan Weber</a>, who&#8217;s coming back to town from his five-year sojourn in Montana.</p>
<p><img src="http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/cash.jpg" border="0" alt="cash.jpg" width="250" height="275" align="left" />But I&#8217;m disheartened <a href="http://www.mediabistro.com/baynewser/bay_area_news_project/qa_lisa_frazier_ceo_bay_area_news_project_149653.asp">by the news</a> that the CEO &#8212; Lisa Frazier, who as far as I can tell has had little or no experience actually managing a news operation (she&#8217;s been a consultant to some big media orgs) &#8212; is being paid $400,000. Maybe she&#8217;s worth that much in the corporate world.</p>
<p>But this is an exorbitant salary for a fledgling nonprofit that will never be all very big compared to the kinds of nonprofits (universities, hospitals, major NGOs, etc.) that pay salaries of this kind. (And some of them go <em>way</em> over the top.)</p>
<p>Frazier&#8217;s pay isn&#8217;t nearly as much as <a href="http://mediactive.com/2009/10/01/non-profit-media-what-you-pay-for-and-who-pays/">Paul Steiger&#8217;s princely score</a> at another nonprofit, <a href="http://propublica.org">ProPublica</a>, but it&#8217;s just as over-the-top in its own way.</p>
<p>Please understand: I support the goals of these organizations. ProPublica&#8217;s journalism to date has been praiseworthy, sometimes superb, and I have no doubt that Jonathan Weber will lead the Bay Area project to do fine work as well.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s clear that the principal funders and boards of directors of both projects have tin ears about how the public correctly sees not-for-profit enterprises &#8212; as organizations that people join not to make a pile of money but because they want to make the world better in some way. I&#8217;m not saying these CEOs should work for a pittance. I am saying that their pay scales send a message they may someday regret.</p>
<p>My bottom line with the Bay Area project, as with ProPublica, is this: I offer my best wishes and moral support for their journalistic  activities, but I won&#8217;t donate any money &#8212; because the message I get from the CEO pay is that they don&#8217;t need my money. I&#8217;ll reserve my financial support for the ones that do.</p>
