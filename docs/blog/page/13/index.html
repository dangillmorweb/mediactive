	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><em>This article was <a href="http://www.salon.com/technology/dan_gillmor/2010/08/10/rand_paul_and_kidnapping/index.html" target="_blank">originally published</a> on Salon on August 10, 2010.</em></p>
<h3>Without evidence, the &#8220;kidnapping&#8221; tale is an example of what media consumers should automatically disbelieve</h3>
<p>UPDATED</p>
<p>So Rand Paul felt <a href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0810/Rand_denies_Aqua_Buddha_stunt_.html?showall" target="_blank">obliged to deny</a> an accusation that he kidnapped a Baylor University swim teammate and forced her to smoke dope.</p>
<p>I believe him. I believed him before he said he didn&#8217;t do it. (Update: And it turns out that no such thing happened, even according to the still-anonymous source for this story. See update below.)</p>
<p>Why? Because the accusation is about something that allegedly happened some 27 years ago, and his accuser is staying anonymous. Sadly, GQ magazine &#8212; which published an otherwise interesting (and better-sourced) account of Paul&#8217;s, uh, socially active college years &#8212; went with this tale.</p>
<p>Even more sadly, the state of American media is such that the accusation has made its way into the mainstream. Bloggers and traditional journalists alike have quoted the GQ piece and given it credence it absolutely hasn&#8217;t earned. Anonymous sources deserve no credibility unless they provide evidence.</p>
<p>I hope Paul loses in November, because I find his politics odious in many ways. But I hope this story doesn&#8217;t sway anyone.</p>
<p>UPDATE: So, according to the Washington Post&#8217;s Greg Sargent, the accuser, who still won&#8217;t give her name, <a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/plum-line/2010/08/rand_pauls_accuser_clarifies_k.html" target="_blank">says the GQ piece was wrong</a> in some vital ways. Namely, it wasn&#8217;t a forced abduction; she was essentially role-playing; no one forced her to take drugs; and the people involved were friends. In other words, however weird (and there&#8217;s definitely some odd behavior here) the situation may have been, it was<em>college party-style weirdness</em>, and nothing resembling the alleged criminality we&#8217;ve been hearing about.</p>
<p>Several comments have raised the appropriate question of whether what happened in college almost three decades ago is relevant to someone&#8217;s fitness for office today. A kidnapping, if it happened, would be relevant, no doubt. It didn&#8217;t happen.</p>
<p>And the other hijinks the GQ story discusses, as well as the anonymous woman&#8217;s latest account (the truth of which I still don&#8217;t take for granted)? Not relevant in the slightest, at least in any sense of disqualifying someone for public office, given how long ago this was and how we all change as we get older. If anything &#8212; given that practically everyone I liked in college was &#8220;lewd, crude and grossly sacreligious&#8221; (characteristics attributed to the group he apparently joined at Baylor) &#8212; they tend to make Paul sound more interesting.</p>
<p>Finally, some of the comments on this item reflect a disturbing reality. Many folks want to believe the worst about Paul, and don&#8217;t care if there&#8217;s any real evidence. I hope they&#8217;ll consider how they&#8217;d feel if someone made this kind of accusation against them or someone they like.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><em>This article was </em><a href="http://www.salon.com/technology/dan_gillmor/2010/08/09/google_verizon_deal/index.html" target="_blank"><em>originally published</em></a><em> on Salon on August 9, 2010.</em></p>
<h3>Ominous references to the &#8220;public Internet&#8221; inescapably suggest something else entirely</h3>
<p>So Google and Verizon had not, in fact, <a href="http://www.salon.com/life/internet_culture/index.html?story=/tech/dan_gillmor/2010/08/05/is_network_neutrality_dead">cooked up a special business deal</a>for their mutual benefit. But what they have cooked up, as <a href="http://googlepublicpolicy.blogspot.com/2010/08/joint-policy-proposal-for-open-internet.html" target="_blank">announced today</a>, may be no great deal for you and me: the idea of a parallel network that could, in the long run, become the default network &#8212; at the very least for entertainment and truly advanced services.</p>
<p>At first glance, no one could argue with what the companies&#8217; CEOs, Eric Schmidt and Ivan Seidenberg, announced on Monday: A &#8220;joint effort by two companies to offer a suggestion&#8221; to public policy makers, as Seidenberg put it. (Both CEOs denounced last week&#8217;s media hyperventilating, based on stories in the New York Times and Bloomberg News, as bogus journalism, though they didn&#8217;t use that precise phrase. &#8220;There is no business relationship,&#8221; Schmidt said on a conference call.)</p>
<p>Their suggestion? Essentially, it was to insist that the Internet should remain open and freely available, with enforcement teeth to ensure what most people would call network neutrality, the idea that carriers can&#8217;t discriminate against one content provider in favor of another.</p>
<p>But the proposal went further. It would promote the expansion of new services, not part of the  Internet as we know it now, that would go beyond anything we have today. These new services, if Congress and regulators enacted the companies&#8217; proposal, could not be designed to be end runs around net neutrality; they would have to be genuinely new.</p>
<p>But here&#8217;s the rub: You should not trust Verizon or other carriers, or Google for that matter, to follow through in ways that are truly in the interest of the kind of open networks the nation needs. Throughout the conference call, we kept hearing references to the &#8220;public Internet&#8221; &#8212; an expression that leads inescapably to something else.</p>
<p>If Schmidt was telling the truth when he said Google&#8217;s overwhelming focus will remain on the public Internet, such as his promise that YouTube will remain there, that&#8217;s great. I have no reason to disbelieve him, and Google&#8217;s track record to date is strong on this issue. But plans change, managements change, and corporate goals change.</p>
<p>The other big news in today&#8217;s announcement was Google&#8217;s clear retreat on network neutrality when it comes to wireless networks. As Susan Crawford, professor at Cardozo Law School and an expert on all things Internet, <a href="http://scrawford.net/blog/leadership-4/1382/" target="_blank">explains</a>: &#8220;That’s a huge hole, given the growing popularity of wireless services and the recent suggestion by the Commission that we may not have a competitive wireless marketplace.&#8221;</p>
<p>For Verizon&#8217;s part, the acceptance of what sounds like fairly serious neutrality rules on current wire-line networks was welcome. But I see the rest as a Trojan Horse for a modern age. Verizon and other carriers have every incentive, based on their legacies, to push network upgrade investments into the parallel Internet, not the public one.</p>
<p>With one exception, the carriers have all but abandoned their push to bring the kind of wired-line bandwidth that other nations &#8212; Japan, South Korea, France and Sweden come immediately to mind &#8212; have done. Verizon has all but stopped building out its fast fiber-optic network to homes, leaving Comcast as the provider that is most ardently boosting connection speeds via its cable lines. (Even Comcast&#8217;s fast speeds are nothing special next to what carriers in those other nations have provided.)</p>
<p>So when Seidenberg said, &#8220;We have to be flexible,&#8221; my immediate thought was, uh-oh.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been worried for years that the game was on to turn the carrier-controlled Internet into just another version of television. Maybe the carriers won&#8217;t get away with that.</p>
<p>The right way forward is to have sufficient bandwidth that we can do pretty much anything we choose using public networks &#8212; a true broadband infrastructure where packet-switched services (moving data around, at super-fast speeds, in little packages that are reassembled at the user&#8217;s device) are the basis for all communications.</p>
<p>Instead, the game is on to create a parallel Internet. It&#8217;ll still be packet-switched. But they won&#8217;t call it the Internet anymore. That&#8217;s an end game we should not encourage.</p>

		<p>This article was <a href="http://www.salon.com/technology/dan_gillmor/2010/08/05/is_network_neutrality_dead/index.html" target="_blank">originally published</a> on Salon on August 5, 2010.</p>
<h3>Reports of backroom deals by big players that would inhibit Web freedom are unconfirmed, but should make us uneasy</h3>
<p>UPDATED</p>
<p>The Internet is abuzz with worries that the <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-08-04/google-verizon-are-said-to-have-reached-deal-on-how-to-handle-web-traffic.html" target="_blank">Bloomberg news service</a> and the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/05/technology/05secret.html" target="_blank">New York Times</a> may have gotten it right in reports that Google and Verizon are cooking up a deal that, in the worst case, would be a blow to our digital future.</p>
<p>The story, denied by both companies (<a href="http://twitter.com/googlepubpolicy/status/20393606477" target="_blank">Google tweet</a>, <a href="http://policyblog.verizon.com/BlogPost/740/NewYorkTimesStoryisMistaken.aspx" target="_blank">Verizon blog post</a>) in language that gives them plenty of wiggle room, essentially says that the corporate giants are on the verge of an agreement that would, as the Times says:</p>
<blockquote><p>allow Verizon to speed some online content to Internet users more quickly if the content’s creators are willing to pay for the privilege.</p>
<p>The charges could be paid by companies, like YouTube, owned by Google, for example, to Verizon, one of the nation’s leading Internet service providers, to ensure that its content received priority as it made its way to consumers. The agreement could eventually lead to higher charges for Internet users.</p></blockquote>
<p>As countless commentators have already agreed, such a deal would mock something that Google has in the past adamantly maintained: the need for content-neutral treatment of what flows on the Net. It&#8217;s usually called &#8220;network neutrality,&#8221; and it means that Internet service providers &#8212; typically your cable and phone company for home broadband connections &#8212; should not get to decide what bits of data get delivered in what order and at what speed, if at all, based on who&#8217;s providing those bits of information.</p>
<p>That is, Verizon should not have the right to decide that it will delay what you see from, say, Salon or my personal blog if Fox News pays Verizon to put its content in the queue first. Why not? Because Internet access is an oligopoly business, creating unprecedented (at least in modern times) choke points for information.</p>
<p>The Federal Communications Commission, which has been making noises about doing more to make net neutrality a requirement, has been holding semi-secret meetings with many of the top players in the online world. If you and I have been represented at that table, it&#8217;s news to me, but this is how so much gets decided in our world. (UPDATE: The FCC has reportedly <a href="http://gigaom.com/2010/08/05/genachowski-man-up-and-silicon-valley-wake-up/" target="_blank">suspended</a> the close-door meetings; good.)</p>
<p>Now we hear that Google &#8212; once the foremost proponent of net neutrality and a participant at those meetings &#8212; may be cooking up a deal with Verizon, which has also been at the FCC table. The scary thing is how plausible this is; Google is a huge company now with interests that may well be diverging from its previous commitments on the matter.</p>
<p>Google CEO Eric Schmidt, speaking yesterday at a conference, told reporters that the company isn&#8217;t backing away in the least from the core<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">principal</span>principle (thanks, pragma). Speaking about network neutrality, he <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13860_3-20012723-56.html" target="_blank">said</a>, according to CNET:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I want to make sure that everybody understands what we mean about it. What we mean is that if you have one data type, like video, you don&#8217;t discriminate against one person&#8217;s video in favor of another. It&#8217;s OK to discriminate across different types &#8230; There is general agreement with Verizon and Google on this issue. The issues of wireless versus wireline get very messy &#8230; and that&#8217;s really an FCC issue not a Google issue.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>So is this about wireless or wired connections, or both? How does this square with the Times report saying that Google would pay Verizon to speed YouTube videos to users&#8217; computers? The murkiness of the entire thing is disturbing, which is one reason it feels too early to declare the imminent death of the Internet as we know it, as some commentators have done.</p>
<p>While I&#8217;m not ready to hyperventilate about this alleged deal, I&#8217;m more than ready to say that the policy and corporate trajectories are going in the wrong direction. I don&#8217;t trust Google to do what&#8217;s best for me. I trust Google to do what&#8217;s best for its shareholders, and if throwing net neutrality under the bus is best for Google the company will do that in a heartbeat &#8212; if allowed.</p>
<p>Take it for granted that the telecom companies will keep pushing for the right to control the content in the data pipes. They don&#8217;t want you to remember that they built their networks in large part with the help of government-granted monopolies and other special help; that would make it harder to claim this absolute control.</p>
<p>The backroom dealing is a big part of the problem here. If the FCC wants to come up with the right policy, it should make transparency part of the method.</p>
<p>Schmidt is board chairman of the <a href="http://www.newamerica.net/" target="_blank">New America Foundation</a>, a smart-thinking organization that has done a lot to elevate policy conversations in recent years. I hope he&#8217;ll read and heed what the foundation said today in a <a href="http://www.newamerica.net/pressroom/2010/gentlemans_agreement_between_industry_titans_no_mission_accomplished_for_an_open_int_0" target="_blank">statement</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>During the 19th century a handful of wealthy industrialists dominated steel, oil refining and railroads; striking agreements to receive favorable terms for the carriage of their goods, while subjecting farmers and competitors to unreasonable and excessive charges.</p>
<p>Now, over a century later, history is in danger of repeating itself. After weeks of closed-door meetings sanctioned by the Federal Communication Commission, two of the largest corporations in the communications industry have reportedly negotiated an agreement on network neutrality. Though details of the agreement are not available, its terms are immaterial. It should not be the policy of the FCC to allow the largest companies to write the regulations that will determine the future of the Internet.</p></blockquote>
<p>UPDATE: Scott Rosenberg <a href="http://www.wordyard.com/2010/08/05/could-googles-neutrality-backstab-be-a-fake/" target="_blank">wonders</a> if the entire leak is just a head-fake, or possibly reflects dissent inside Google. Meanwhile, Google has put out a more strenuous denial, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2010/aug/05/gogle-denies-verizon-deal-net-neutrality" target="_blank">telling</a> the Guardian, among others: &#8220;The New York Times is quite simply wrong. We have not had any conversations with Verizon about paying for carriage of Google traffic. We remain as committed as we always have been to an open internet.&#8221;</p>

		<p><em>This article was </em><a href="http://www.salon.com/technology/dan_gillmor/2010/08/04/body_scanning_mission_creep/index.html" target="_blank"><em>originally published</em></a><em> on Salon on August 4, 2010.</em></p>
<h3>When officials claim limited goals and strong privacy guarantees with security technology, don&#8217;t believe them</h3>
<p>When government officials launch new security technologies, they always promise that the devices and methods will A) not unnecessarily invade people&#8217;s privacy;  B) have strong policies in place to prevent abuse; and C) not go beyond their initial mandate. Then they break the promises.</p>
<p>The latest case in point involves the full-body scanners that are being installed in airports and some other federal installations: As CNET<a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-31921_3-20012583-281.html?tag=topTechContentWrap;editorPicks" target="_blank">reports</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>For the last few years, federal agencies have defended body scanning by insisting that all images will be discarded as soon as they&#8217;re viewed. The Transportation Security Administration claimed last summer, for instance, that &#8220;scanned images cannot be stored or recorded.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now it turns out that some police agencies are storing the controversial images after all. The U.S. Marshals Service admitted this week that it had surreptitiously saved tens of thousands of images recorded with a millimeter wave system at the security checkpoint of a single Florida courthouse.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s an example of &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_creep" target="_blank">mission creep</a>&#8221; &#8212; the pervasive tendency to expand original goals or tactics beyond supposedly narrow original goals. It&#8217;s how laws supposedly aimed solely at crime lords end up being used against average folks. The only surprise in this case is that anyone would be surprised.</p>
<p>The misrepresentations about the body scanners have been a key feature of the machines&#8217; rollout. First we were told that no images could be stored because they&#8217;d be <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/TRAVEL/05/18/airport.security.body.scans/index.html" target="_blank">automatically deleted</a>. Whoops, <a href="http://epic.org/2010/04/tsa-concedes-body-scanners-sto.html" target="_blank">not true</a>. In fact, these machines are specifically <em><a href="http://epic.org/open_gov/foia/TSA_Procurement_Specs.pdf" target="_blank">designed</a></em> to store the images.</p>
<p>Now the Department of Homeland Security has done what everyone paying attention knew was coming: It&#8217;s mandating the rollout of the body scanners nationwide. Soon, everyone who flies will be invited to bare all for the sake of security.</p>
<p>But you don&#8217;t have to actually go through the scanner, right? Isn&#8217;t there an option to be checked in some other way? There sure is, but be prepared for <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/travel/ct-trav-trouble-0503-story,0,5740864.story" target="_blank">a serious hassle</a> if you do.</p>
<p>Be prepared for some other upcoming realities. Even though lots of celebrities make sex tapes, there are at least a few movie stars and other public figures who have retained some old-fashioned modesty. Think any of these folks, however they regard their own privacy, won&#8217;t be targets? Think again.</p>
<p>And watch as the full body scan becomes less and less optional if you want to actually catch your flight. Either it&#8217;ll be mandatory, or the alternative will be hugely time-consuming and/or physically invasive. So if you find yourself shocked one day that yet another vestige of your liberty and dignity has been taken away, you won&#8217;t have been paying attention.</p>

		<p><em>This article was <a href="http://www.salon.com/technology/dan_gillmor/2010/08/02/online_surveillance_grows/index.html" target="_blank">originally published</a></em><em> on Salon on August 2, 2010.</em></p>
<h3>Our Web browsing habits are under growing surveillance. Can we fight back?</h3>
<p>UPDATED</p>
<p>The next time you leave home, are you willing to have someone follow you with a video camera? The idea would be to record every step you take, everything you look at and especially everything you purchase. That information would be available to people you don&#8217;t know and whose specific reasons for wanting to see it &#8212; apart from wanting to know your habits better so they can sell you things &#8212; are considered none of your business.</p>
<p>This is the rough equivalent of what happens when you browse online these days, and not just at shopping sites. Data surveillance by marketers, as the Wall Street Journal is describing in a <a href="http://www.wsj.com/wtk" target="_blank">series of articles</a>that started running over the weekend, is one of the online world&#8217;s &#8220;fastest-growing businesses.&#8221;</p>
<p>The main article begins by describing the eerily granular information that online surveillance and marketing companies have learned about Ashley Hayes-Beaty, a 26-year-old woman in Nashville, without her direct knowledge or permission. Then we are told:</p>
<blockquote><p>In between the Internet user and the advertiser, the Journal identified more than 100 middlemen &#8212; tracking companies, data brokers and advertising networks &#8212; competing to meet the growing demand for data on individual behavior and interests. The data on Ms. Hayes-Beaty’s film-watching habits, for instance, is being offered to advertisers on BlueKai Inc., one of the new data exchanges.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>“It is a sea change in the way the industry works,” says Omar Tawakol, CEO of BlueKai. “Advertisers want to buy access to people, not Web pages.”</p>
<p>The Journal examined the 50 most popular U.S. websites, which account for about 40% of the Web pages viewed by Americans. (The Journal also tested its own site, WSJ.com.) It then analyzed the tracking files and programs these sites downloaded onto a test computer.</p>
<p>As a group, the top 50 sites placed 3,180 tracking files in total on the Journal’s test computer. Nearly a third of these were innocuous, deployed to remember the password to a favorite site or tally most-popular articles.</p>
<p>But over two-thirds—2,224—were installed by 131 companies, many of which are in the business of tracking Web users to create rich databases of consumer profiles that can be sold.</p></blockquote>
<p>To be sure, the Journal&#8217;s coverage is lurid &#8212; more so than necessary to make the point. And the series, at least so far, doesn&#8217;t address the disturbingly huge amount of information collection and sales by the shadowy offline industry that combines our credit-card, banking and other information into a gigantic data bazaar over which we have little or no control.</p>
<p>That said, the Journal&#8217;s coverage is valuable in at least one respect: It explains just how pervasive the surveillance has become and with what indifference the people doing the surveillance view your privacy.</p>
<p>They will say, with some truth, that it&#8217;s all in the interest of creating advertising and services aimed at your interests. Why, then, do they cloak what they do in such opaque ways?</p>
<p>My friend Jeff Jarvis, who leads an unusually public life, says the Journal is <a href="http://www.buzzmachine.com/2010/07/31/cookie-madness" target="_blank">telling us nothing</a> we don&#8217;t already know. Granted, the fact that websites have put cookies and other user-observation mechanisms on our computers is not news. But do we all know that tracking systems have become not just ubiquitious but also disturbingly interlinked? I pay fairly close attention to this field, and the Journal series has opened my eyes a bit wider; for those who have a vague idea of what&#8217;s going on, the stories may well come as a nasty shock.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m closer to what another friend, <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/doc/2010/07/31/the-data-bubble/" target="_blank">Doc Searls, concludes</a>: This is creepy, and we need to turn it around. Doc, a Fellow at the Harvard <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society</a>, writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>There is no demand for tracking by individual customers. All the demand comes from advertisers — or from companies selling to advertisers.</p>
<p>For now.</p>
<p>Here is the difference between an advertiser and an ordinary company just trying to sell stuff to customers: nothing. If a better way to sell stuff comes along — especially if customers like it better than this crap the Journal is reporting on — advertising is in trouble.</p>
<p>Here is the difference between an active customer who wants to buy stuff and a consumer targeted by secretive tracking bullshit: everything.</p>
<p>Two things are going to happen here. One is that we’ll stop putting up with it. The other is that we’ll find better ways for demand and supply to meet — ways that don’t involve tracking or the guesswork called advertising.</p></blockquote>
<p>Doc is working on a project to create &#8220;<a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/projectvrm/Main_Page" target="_blank">Vendor Relationship Management</a>,&#8221; turning on its head the idea that sellers should manage customers. Rather, he says, we should be the ones in charge.</p>
<p>At best, getting there from where we are will take years. What do we do in the meantime?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s encouraging to see that venture funders have &#8220;spotted a new market opening and are pumping millions of dollars into privacy-related start-ups,&#8221; as the Journal <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703438604575315182025721578.html?KEYWORDS=privacy+venture+capital" target="_blank">reported</a> last month. What we need, sooner than later, are tools to manage our own privacy.</p>
<p>When I browse I use several extra tools in the browser that help me block unwanted spying. In particular, Firefox has a well-developed add-on ecosystem including <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/6623/" target="_blank">BetterPrivacy</a> (for &#8220;super-cookies like Adobe&#8217;s irritating Flash plug-ins) and <a href="http://noscript.net/" target="_blank">NoScript</a> (lets me specify by domain). Whatever browser you use most, you&#8217;ll probably be able to find ways to block at least some unwanted behavior. I&#8217;m testing <a href="http://www.getabine.com/" target="_blank">Abine</a>&#8216;s tools, which go much further than others (<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/06/17/firefox_taco_addon_beefs_up/" target="_blank">too far</a>, by some accounts), as well.</p>
<p>One thing I don&#8217;t do is block cookies from host sites. I don&#8217;t mind at all if a website I use regularly &#8212; especially a site offering me services at no charge &#8212; wants to keep track of what I do there, or ask me to register. These are entirely fair tradeoffs.</p>
<p>What I mind a great deal is when that information becomes cross-referenced with what other sites and services learn about me. What I do at the Journal&#8217;s site (which I pay for, making further data collection even more outrageous, in my view) is emphatically not the business of, say, Dictionary.com, or vice versa. Yet I have no clear idea if they or third-party data collectors are sharing or cross-referencing, or what they&#8217;re doing with the data if they are.</p>
<p>The alleged transparency efforts by data collectors is an illusion of openness. Read the various privacy statements and disclosures, not  just on the sites you&#8217;ve visited but the third-party trackers they don&#8217;t always tell you about, and if you can decipher it all you&#8217;re a lot smarter than the rest of us. It&#8217;s obfuscation and plainly designed to be.</p>
<p>A few years ago, when supermarkets started offering frequent-shopper cards that provided discounts in return  for creating shopper databases, some people I knew came up with a clever idea. They met once a month and put their cards into a hat, then drew someone else&#8217;s card out of the hat and used it. This clearly violated the spirit of the bargain, and probably the letter, too. But it reflected a wise mistrust of the corporate motives behind the shopping cards, especially because it was not clear what would happen to the data.</p>
<p>I suspect we&#8217;ll need to do things like this on the Web, too. Until we have vastly more transparency from the companies collecting, massaging, renting and selling this information, I&#8217;ll be inclined to mislead the marketers.</p>

		<p><em>This article was </em><a href="http://www.salon.com/technology/dan_gillmor/2010/07/29/sherrod_to_sue_breitbart/index.html" target="_blank"><em>originally published</em></a><em> on Salon on July 29, 2010.</em></p>
<h3>Andrew Breitbart should be held accountable for his deceptions, but is there a libel case here?</h3>
<p>This is no surprise: <a href="http://www.salon.com/news/shirley_sherrod/index.html">Shirley Sherrod</a>, the Agriculture Department official who was forced out in the wake of false claims that racist views affected her work, says <a href="http://www.salon.com/news/2010/07/29/us_usda_racism_resignation_5/index.html">she&#8217;ll sue</a> Andrew Breitbart for his bogus &#8220;journalism&#8221; about her. But are the courts the best place to hold him accountable for his sleaze?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not a lawyer, so I&#8217;m not going to predict the outcome of any Sherrod libel claim. A court &#8212; and Sherrod herself &#8212; would have a number of issues to consider, however.</p>
<p>One is whether Sherrod was a public official or public figure at the time when Breitbart posted his now-infamous Web article featuring an excerpt from a video that purported to show her, an African-American, acknowledging racial bias against white farmers and then acting on it to their detriment. (Your town&#8217;s mayor is a public official; Lindsay Lohan is a public figure. Which makes California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger both, I suppose.)</p>
<p>Public officials and public figures have higher hurdles in libel cases, thanks to Supreme Court rulings that required a showing of &#8220;actual malice&#8221; on the part of the person making the false statement. Essentially, malice means that the defamatory material was published with the knowledge that it was false, or that the publisher showed &#8220;reckless disregard&#8221; for the truth. (See the Electronic Frontier Foundation&#8217;s <a href="http://www.eff.org/issues/bloggers/legal/liability/defamation" target="_blank">page on defamation law</a> for more detail.)</p>
<p>Breitbart has claimed he didn&#8217;t know the video was a hack job &#8212; purporting to show racism when in fact her point, made clear in the context of the full recording, was that the issue was class, not race and that she did her best to help the farmers. If he didn&#8217;t know, did he try to find out? Would that matter in a libel case?</p>
<p>Even if he&#8217;s telling the truth about not knowing the true nature of the video, and even if that is enough to make the commentary non-libelous, Breitbart may have another problem: his bogus <a href="http://biggovernment.com/abreitbart/2010/07/19/video-proof-the-naacp-awards-racism2010/" target="_blank">&#8220;correction&#8221; of the original</a>. Here&#8217;s the correction:</p>
<blockquote><p>While Ms. Sherrod made the remarks captured in the first video featured in this post while she held a federally appointed position, the story she tells refers to actions she took before she held that federal position.</p></blockquote>
<p>As friend and colleague Scott Rosenberg has pointed out, this is not much better than the original.</p>
<p>A genuine correction, Scott <a href="http://www.wordyard.com/2010/07/22/breitbart-fiddles-while-the-msm-refuses-to-burn-him/" target="_blank">writes</a>, would read something like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our original story was wrong. We quoted Sherrod to suggest that she drove an old white couple off their farm because she was a racist. In fact, she helped that couple hold onto their farm and used the tale to argue against racism.</p></blockquote>
<p>So, even if the original wasn&#8217;t libelous under the current public-figure standard, is Breitbart&#8217;s refusal to admit he was wrong about so much &#8212; in the face of utterly clear evidence &#8212; legally actionable? Again, I&#8217;m not a lawyer, but I have a feeling we&#8217;re going to find out the answer.</p>
<p>David Ardia, director of the <a href="http://citmedialaw.org/" target="_blank">Citizen Media Law Project</a> at Harvard&#8217;s<a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society</a> (I co-founded the project when I was a fellow at the center several years ago), says the correction &#8220;appears to give her a stronger case on the question of actual malice&#8221; than the original posting &#8212; again assuming Breitbart wasn&#8217;t complicit in the video&#8217;s editing. These cases depend on state of mind, he says, but it seems clear that Breitbart knew at the time he posted the correction what was in the full video.</p>
<p>Some other questions, legal and otherwise, that may come up include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Will California&#8217;s shield law let Breitbart keep the name of his source confidential?</li>
<li>Should anonymous sources be permitted to launder their defamations through others? (I&#8217;ll be coming back to this in another posting.)</li>
<li>Was Breitbart doing journalism, however crappy it may have been?</li>
<li>Has Sherrod ever said or done anything that could fairly be characterized as having racist intent, regardless of what happened in this case?</li>
</ul>
<p>If Sherrod proceeds with this case, her adult life will almost certainly be put under a microscope &#8212; this one with a court order behind it in discovery proceedings &#8212; where Breitbart&#8217;s lawyers look for even a hint that she&#8217;s the kind of person Breitbart was claiming in the first place. Can anyone whose father was lynched by white racists <em>not</em> have had such things to say, ever? My sympathies lie strongly with Sherrod, and I&#8217;d hope a jury&#8217;s would as well, but I wonder if she&#8217;s ready for the legal attack dogs who may demonstrate even less honor, if that&#8217;s possible, than Breitbart.</p>
<p>David Ardia notes that individuals seeking libel damages, even when totally justified, often don&#8217;t get the results they expect in an often vicious process. In fact, he tells me, it&#8217;s fairly rare to get anything close to full satisfaction.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s one more question, and I still think it&#8217;s the most important one.</p>
<ul>
<li>Why should anyone believe anything Breitbart says at this point?</li>
</ul>
<p>The answer, of course, is that Breitbart has no credibility whatever among those who count honor and fairness as an element of journalism. He could regain some with a forthright admission of what he did, but at this point that looks unlikely.</p>
<p>Sadly, he still has a substantial audience. I hope anyone reading this is not among its members.</p>

<h3>Federal ruling allows slightly more freedom to use what you&#8217;ve bought the way you want, but much more is needed</h3>
<p>Good news in the copyright world is rare, but we have a couple of small victories to celebrate this week. The bad news: They only emphasize how grossly unbalanced our system remains.</p>
<p>These wins for customer freedom center around a technology broadly known as DRM, which stands for Digital Rights Management &#8212; methods used by hardware and software companies to allow customers only certain rights. It should more properly be called Digital Restrictions Management, because that&#8217;s the real aim of DRM. People have found ways to break or work around DRM, but federal law makes it illegal to do so in most circumstances.</p>
<p>The cracks in DRM&#8217;s legal facade are starting to grow, too. On Monday, the Copyright Office and librarian of Congress said, among other things,<a href="http://www.copyright.gov/1201/2010/Librarian-of-Congress-1201-Statement.html" target="_blank">that it&#8217;s OK</a> to A) &#8220;jailbreak&#8221; your phone, thereby letting you install software not approved by the phone seller; and B) use brief excerpts of DVD videos in other works. Renewing a previously granted exception to federal copyright law, the office also said it was OK to unlock your phone so that you can use it with a different mobile network.</p>
<p>The exceptions are still fairly narrow, to be sure, and how widely they&#8217;ll be used remains to be seen given the way our mobile phone and media markets work in the real world. But they&#8217;re notable in several ways.</p>
<p>One is the language the Librarian of Congress, James Billington, used in his <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/1201/2010/RM-2008-8.pdf" target="_blank">rulemaking document</a> (1.5MB PDF). For example, he called the act of jailbreaking a phone &#8220;innocuous at worst and beneficial at best.&#8221;</p>
<p>Industry arguments against these exceptions, for which the <a href="http://eff.org/" target="_blank">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> had led the fight, had been laugh-out-loud ridiculous. <a href="http://www.salon.com/technology/apple/index.html">Apple</a>, you&#8217;ll be unsurprised to hear, took the hardest-line stance against the concept that customers should have the right to use the devices they&#8217;ve purchased as they see fit.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s objections ultimately came down to its insistence that customer freedoms would &#8220;undercut the overall <em>iPhone experience</em>&#8221; (emphasis from the original <a href="http://www.eff.org/files/filenode/dmca_2009/EFF%20Supplemental%20Answers%20DVD.pdf" target="_blank">document</a> filed in the case). In other words, you should only be able to use the iPhone, which is nothing more than a handheld computer connected to digital networks &#8212; albeit a wonderfully designed device &#8212; in precisely the ways Apple determines.</p>
<p>Having lost in the Copyright Office, Apple responded with typical arrogance, telling the Cult of Mac blog that it might now be legal to use your iPhone the way you want to, but you&#8217;ll <a href="http://www.cultofmac.com/apples-official-response-to-dmca-jailbreak-exemption-it-voids-your-warranty/52463" target="_blank">void the warranty</a> if you do. And you can expect Apple to keep up its cat-and-mouse game of using software updates to screw up jailbroken phones, as the iPhone Dev-Team &#8212; leaders of the jailbreaking movement &#8212; <a href="http://blog.iphone-dev.org/post/862193913/getting-out-of-jail-is-free" target="_blank">are warning</a>.</p>
<p>The continued ability to unlock your phone and use it on a competing network isn&#8217;t much help, because of the insanity of America&#8217;s competing mobile standards. Even if you unlock a newer iPhone, you can&#8217;t use it to its maximum capabilities on Verizon, Sprint or T-Mobile because of various radio and chip incompatibilites.</p>
<p>But if you travel overseas frequently, unlocking your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GSM" target="_blank">GSM</a>-based AT&amp;T or T-Mobile phone will be nontrivial (assuming it isn&#8217;t already unlocked, as mine is). You can use local SIM cards in many countries and save a huge amount of money.</p>
<p>The other important move by the Copyright Office was to allow people to remix videos in other works. Essentially, the copyright officials observed that it was ridiculous to believe that we&#8217;re all but forbidden from quoting from others&#8217; creative work just because it&#8217;s in a DRM&#8217;d video format.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this exception is way too narrow in the real world. It allows circumvention of the DRM solely for:</p>
<blockquote><p>(i) Educational uses by college and university professors and by college and university film and media studies students;</p>
<p>(ii) Documentary filmmaking;</p>
<p>(iii) Noncommercial videos.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, it&#8217;s still not allowed to quote from another video work for commercial use (other than in a documentary). This is nuts. If authors had to get permission from every writer or publisher whose work they intended to quote, scholarship and journalism would grind to a halt.</p>
<p>The copyright office&#8217;s exemptions also included the right to bypass computer system <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dongle" target="_blank">dongles</a> that are broken or obsolete; a research exception for studying video game security; and read-aloud functions in e-books if not provided by the publisher.</p>
<p>Again, we shouldn&#8217;t overstate the value of Monday&#8217;s ruling. The law remains horribly unbalanced in favor of the copyright holders. But any progress is helpful.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><em>This article was </em><a href="http://www.salon.com/technology/dan_gillmor/2010/07/26/wikileaks_roils_media_and_politics/index.html" target="_blank"><em>originally published</em></a><em> on Salon on July 26, 2010.</em></p>
<h3>Afghanistan diaries mock secrecy and highlight shifts in war, politics, media. Look for a counterattack</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to escape the sense that we&#8217;ve hit one of those historical pivot points in the wake of  WikiLeaks&#8217; <a href="http://wardiary.wikileaks.org/" target="_blank">release</a> of the Afghanistan war document trove. ﻿The conduct of politics, war and media &#8212; so intertwined these days &#8212; has changed irrevocably.</p>
<p>A few points seem clear (I plan to revise this as new information becomes available):</p>
<p><strong>First:</strong> Daniel Ellsberg <a href="http://www.democracynow.org/2010/7/26/the_new_pentagon_papers_wikileaks_releases" target="_blank">said today</a> this is comparable to the Pentagon Papers, which he leaked to the New York Times and others back in the 1970s. I&#8217;m old enough to remember that event, and it was a pivotal moment in its own right. (The Atlantic&#8217;s Jim Fallows has <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2010/07/on-the-afpak-wikileaks-documents/60379/" target="_blank">valuable perspective</a> on the larger meaning of both leaks, as well as their similarities in key ways, as they applied to American policy and war aims.)</p>
<p>If he was contemplating the same decision today, Ellsberg <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/19/business/media/19link.html" target="_blank">said in April</a>, he&#8217;d just scan the documents and put them online. But just posting documents isn&#8217;t enough. While media are becoming democratized, there&#8217;s still the matter of getting people&#8217;s attention beyond a small circle of those who care deeply about any given topic. You want the biggest bang for the buck, you still take your story to the media organizations that will give your story a ride.</p>
<p>So the fact that WikiLeaks&#8221; Julian Assange gave an early look at the documents to three selected organizations &#8212; the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/world/war-logs.html" target="_blank">New York Times</a>, the<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/series/afghanistan-the-war-logs" target="_blank">Guardian</a> and <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,708314,00.html" target="_blank">Der Spiegel</a> &#8212; is proof of his incredible savvy at how traditional media actually operate. In a recent <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/06/07/100607fa_fact_khatchadourian" target="_blank">New Yorker profile</a>, he lamented the general uninterest he perceived among journalists when it came to huge stories. ﻿When everybody has the story, he realized, they don&#8217;t care much about it.</p>
<p>When a few selected journalists at major institutions get it first, that&#8217;s how you create buzz. This says more about journalists&#8217; competitive instincts and their Pavlovian response to &#8220;exclusives&#8221; than it does about their willingness to actually do their jobs for their audiences.</p>
<p><strong>Second:</strong> WikiLeaks&#8217; roles &#8212; intermediary, publisher, P.R. agent and more &#8212; is not utterly unprecedented, but the size and importance of this story takes the shifting changes in media to new levels. (Do read Jay Rosen&#8217;s <a href="http://journalism.nyu.edu/pubzone/weblogs/pressthink/2010/07/26/wikileaks_afghan.html" target="_blank">smart instant analysis</a> on all of this.) What do we make of such a &#8220;stateless news organization,&#8221; as Jay elegantly puts it, which works so hard to subvert so many media assumptions of the past?</p>
<p>Even though the New York Times took huge care in what it printed, and kept some of the material out of its own reports at the request of the Obama administration, a newspaper&#8217;s redaction is not very important if WikiLeaks puts out everything on its own.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a big &#8220;if&#8221; &#8212; because WikiLeaks <em>hasn&#8217;t</em> put everything out. On its <a href="http://wardiary.wikileaks.org/" target="_blank">War Diary</a> front page, here&#8217;s this item:</p>
<blockquote><p>﻿We have delayed the release of some 15,000 reports from total archive as part of a harm minimization process demanded by our source. After further review, these reports will be released, with occasional redactions, and eventually, in full, as the security situation in Afghanistan permits.</p></blockquote>
<p>We&#8217;ve become accustomed to seeing traditional news organizations delay publication or broadcasts at the request of governments. The New York Times, you&#8217;ll recall, <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2187498" target="_blank">held off for more than a year</a> when it came to telling the American people about the Bush administration&#8217;s illegal surveillance of our communications &#8212; a decision made in what the paper considered journalistic good faith but which to many of us was an outright betrayal of the craft.</p>
<p>Journalists also do what sources demand, if that&#8217;s what it takes to get stories. This is why so many articles have so many unnamed sources.</p>
<p>In this instance, WikiLeaks is holding back, at least temporarily, to keep its source happy. You and I can&#8217;t judge whether this is really about minimizing harm or something else. We have to take WikiLeaks at its word, for now. One reason we may be more inclined to do so is the promise that these new documents will be released in full at some point.</p>
<p><strong>Third:</strong> A week ago &#8212; seems longer, doesn&#8217;t it? &#8212; the Washington Post ran a superb series of articles on how America&#8217;s national-security state is emerging from the 9/11 paranoia, a <a href="http://projects.washingtonpost.com/top-secret-america/" target="_blank">&#8220;Top Secret America&#8221;</a> that is at once terrifying and expected given the public&#8217;s twitchy fears and politicians&#8217; eagerness to cater to our worst instincts. We learned that almost 900,000 people holding &#8220;top-secret&#8221; clearance are part of an apparatus that almost certainly spies on everything and everyone it can identify as even remotely, potentially, possibly suspicious &#8212; with no real oversight.</p>
<p>(This helps explain the White House&#8217;s panicky response to the WikiLeaks war documents, including the spectacle of administration officials complaining that Assange is antiwar and therefore must not be trusted. What if he is? The documents speak for themselves. Or do they? It&#8217;s an impressive number, 90,000 documents with the promise of 15,000 more, but do they provide full context? We don&#8217;t know. I&#8217;ll discuss this in an update later.)</p>
<p>﻿Whatever our keepers of intelligence secrets do know, and whatever abuses they&#8217;ve done to our civil liberties to learn them, they must feel less sure today about keeping it all contained. When that many people have access to information, however compartmentalized their bosses may think they&#8217;ve made the system, some of it will get out, which leads to something else we should worry about.</p>
<p><strong>Fourth:</strong> The WikiLeaks war diary will absolutely spur our powerful institutions to look for increasingly draconian ways to clamp down on how we share information. What WikiLeaks represents is what governments and corporations fear: a threat to their cultures of secrecy and dominance in their domains.</p>
<p>Look for Washington and our corporate media to call for new laws to stop this kind of thing. Politicians and bureaucrats who don&#8217;t trust us to know what&#8217;s really going on &#8212; they are legion in both major parties &#8212; have allies among the traditional media and the entertainment industry that would gain enormously if the Internet were to be turned into a slightly more interactive version of 20th century print and broadcast media.</p>
<p>If you think the rich and powerful people who run governments and corporate media aren&#8217;t working every day to turn back the clock on information they can&#8217;t control, you&#8217;re not paying attention.﻿ WikiLeaks may well have given them new ammunition for pushing the harshest kinds of restrictions. Do we want to be like Saudi Arabia and China? We may find out one of these days, sooner rather than later.</p>
<p><strong>Finally, this:</strong> I have donated money to WikiLeaks in the past. I plan to donate in the future. ﻿What Assange and his team are doing is an inevitable result of what technology has brought us in democratizing our media. Some of what they do troubles me. But the bottom line seems to be this: They are performing a public service.</p>

<h3>When the Andrew Breitbarts of the world can spread lies with lightning speed, knee-jerk reactions are dangerous</h3>
<p>UPDATED</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re one of the people who believed, even for a minute, that former U.S. Agriculture Department employee <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;tbs=nws%3A1&amp;q=shirley+sherrod&amp;aq=0z&amp;aqi=g-z3&amp;aql=&amp;oq=shirley+sherrod%22&amp;gs_rfai=" target="_blank">Shirley Sherrod</a> misused her government position in racist ways, you have plenty of company &#8212; and you may also believe you have a plausible excuse. After all, you were told by Big Media, the Obama administration and the NAACP that it was true.</p>
<p>Except, as we&#8217;ve all learned, it wasn&#8217;t true. It was a brazen lie, pushed initially by the infamous <a href="http://www.salon.com/news/andrew_breitbart/index.html">Andrew Breitbart</a> and his allies at Fox News and other right-wing media outlets, and given credence via the cravenness of other media organizations, Obama&#8217;s secretary of agriculture and America&#8217;s most prominent civil rights organization.</p>
<p>No surprise that Fox and others leaped aboard the Breitbart wagon: Here was &#8220;news&#8221; that A) fit their worldview and B) came with video. So what if the video was incomplete. Don&#8217;t look for even a shred of genuine remorse, ever.</p>
<p>(UPDATE: Looks like I spoke too soon on that; watching Fox this evening, I heard some commentators offering sound cautions about leaping to conclusions &#8212; and Bill O&#8217;Reilly has forthrightly <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/linkset/2005/04/11/LI2005041100587.html?hpid=topnews" target="_blank">apologized</a>, according to the Washington Post. Let&#8217;s welcome these thoughts and hope the Fox audience pays attention. Further update: Josh Marshall, in<a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/2010/07/shame_on_obama.php" target="_blank">a scathing piece</a> on the media&#8217;s failure in this case, calls the Post story a whitewash.)</p>
<p>The other players named above, who credulously endorsed the lie, should be ashamed. Afraid that they might be seen as giving cover to a black person with racist thoughts, they leaped on the discredited &#8220;evidence.&#8221; At least the NAACP <a href="http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/07/21/longer-video-of-sherrod-speech-is-released-by-n-a-a-c-p/" target="_blank">apologized</a> for its role in the smear. (UPDATE: And, as we&#8217;ve all heard now, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/22/us/politics/22sherrod.html?_r=1&amp;hpw" target="_blank">so has the administration</a>.)</p>
<p>But the misdeeds by others don&#8217;t let the rest of us off the hook. And if this isn&#8217;t a teaching moment about media, politics and our twitchy culture, nothing is.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m lucky, in a way. I first heard about the story and Breitbart&#8217;s role in it at the same time. So I instantly had doubts.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t doubt that an African-American could express racist ideas. What I doubted was that Breitbart could be taken at face value. His <a href="http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/joan_walsh/politics/2010/04/13/andrew_breitbart_misleading_video">record</a> was evidence, beyond my reasonable suspicion from my perspective, that the only smart way to approach his work is to wait for absolute proof &#8212; and not trust anything until seeing it. And his <a href="http://mediamatters.org/blog/201007210024" target="_blank">sulphuric spin</a> of the current situation is beyond disgusting.</p>
<p>In our evolving media ecosystem, we should be skeptical of everything we read, see or hear &#8212; online and in traditional media. But we should not be <em>equally</em> skeptical of everything. We need to find sources we trust (more than not) and recognize that even they will make mistakes.</p>
<p>This means, in particular, that we all need to take a deep breath before making knee-jerk assumptions, or at least before we act on them. The consequences of acting before verifying can be minor, or they can be ugly &#8212; as in Sherrod&#8217;s blatantly unfair forced resignation.</p>
<p>I heard some regret on CNN last night for its role in spreading the lies, and hope other big-media organizations are doing the same. That&#8217;s not the real test, however. What they do in the future is the test, and it&#8217;s an easy one: The next time you see a Breitbart-pushed story moved forward by a serious journalism organization that hasn&#8217;t checked out the facts in every particular, you&#8217;ll know that organization has failed.</p>
<p>Time for an office pool on which one will fail first. I can all but guarantee, with sadness, that someone in the office will win.</p>
<p><em>(Update also reflects that Fox was hardly the only conservative media outlets to find this story worth covering.)</em></p>

		<p><em>This article was <a href="http://www.salon.com/technology/dan_gillmor/2010/07/19/saving_our_digital_heritage/index.html" target="_blank">originally published</a> on Salon on July 19, 2010.</em></p>
<h3>The Library of Congress and other preservation-minded organizations ponder how we preserve what we&#8217;re creating</h3>
<p>They&#8217;re trying to save the news. Among other things.</p>
<p>No, this isn&#8217;t yet another thumb-sucking cogitation about the future of journalism, at least not the kind we typically see these days. Rather, this is about a different issue: How do we save journalism (and other media) that&#8217;s already been created &#8212; including the all too ephemeral information that we&#8217;re creating online?</p>
<p>This week in Washington, DC, the <a href="http://www.loc.gov/" target="_blank">Library of Congress</a> is gathering its &#8220;Digital Preservation Partners&#8221; for a three-day session &#8212; one of a number of such meetings the library has been holding under a broad initiative called the &#8220;<a href="http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/" target="_blank">National Digital Information Infrastructure and Preservation Program</a>.&#8221; Its multi-year mission is:</p>
<blockquote><p>to develop a national strategy to collect, preserve and make available significant digital content, especially information that is created in digital form only, for current and future generations.﻿</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s what my technology friends call a non-trivial task, for all kinds of technical, social and legal reasons. But it&#8217;s about as important for our future as anything I can imagine. We are creating vast amounts of information, and a lot of it is not just worth preserving but downright essential to save.</p>
<p>My role this week, and at a workshop I joined last year, is to be thinking about the news. My mind almost explodes when I consider the issues.</p>
<p>Even when there were relatively few community information sources &#8212; mostly newspapers &#8212; we had preservation issues. I started my newspaper career at a small weekly that has long since closed down. While I&#8217;m sure someone, somewhere, has a printed copy of the issues, the journalism is nowhere to be found online. And what happens when a newspaper with some printed archives and some online shuts down? Sometimes those archives <a href="http://tucsoncitizen.com/godblogging/2009/08/06/the-arizona-historical-society-vs-gannett-co-inc/" target="_blank">go dark</a>, too.</p>
<p>Even newspaper archives that exist online tend to live behind paywalls that prevent most people from using them. This greedy policy, which I&#8217;ve <a href="http://dangillmor.typepad.com/dan_gillmor_on_grassroots/2005/01/newspapers_open.html" target="_blank">discussed before</a>, has helped ensure that newspapers are less relevant in their communities than they should be.</p>
<p>A newspaper company I worked for deleted years worth of my blogging, twice. Once was when it changed publishing platforms. The second time was after I left the company. With some technical help I <a href="http://bayosphere.com/2009/10/26/welcome-to-my-old-blog/" target="_blank">recovered and republished</a> most of it myself.</p>
<p>TV and radio broadcasters have tended to save tapes or digital archives, though huge gaps have emerged in the record. Remember, storage used to be expensive.</p>
<p>The rise of citizen media has complicated everything. Now we had vast new sources of information, some useful and some not. (Kind of like traditional media, no?) Who had the obligation, if there was one, to save this material?</p>
<p>Well, we have the wonderful <a href="http://www.archive.org/about/bios.php" target="_blank">Brewster Kahle</a> and his team at the <a href="http://archive.org/" target="_blank">Internet Archive</a> to thank that a bunch of it still exists (including my old blogging that we recovered, no thanks to the newspaper company that killed it). The reality, however, is that much of the Web &#8212; not to mention many if not most of the great BBS conversations of earlier times &#8212; is lost.</p>
<p>After last year&#8217;s digital preservation meeting I suggested that we needed better ways to <a href="http://mediactive.com/2009/09/04/archiving-the-news-auto-preserving-blogs/" target="_blank">do our own archiving</a> of blogs and other social media. I still believe the Library of Congress, Internet Archive and other preservation-minded folks should help the rest of us with this task.</p>
<p>The social question arises about people who <em>don&#8217;t</em> want to save what they&#8217;ve done.? Do they have a right to delete it? The Archive will take things down on request. But once you&#8217;ve put something up publicly, isn&#8217;t it public?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not just a social question, but a legal one, now that judges are<a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20100706/ap_on_hi_te/us_newspapers_expunging_stories" target="_blank">ordering</a> <a href="http://www.eschoolnews.com/2010/07/07/judge-orders-school-newspaper-to-delete-stories/" target="_blank">newspapers</a> to delete archived stories. It&#8217;s a legal issue as well because copyright laws are constantly getting in the way of reasonable use of published material. The entertainment industry has taken us down a troubling path in this regard, and things are only getting worse.</p>
<p>And then there&#8217;s the entire question of material we create spontaneously, using databases that provide individualized experiences when we seek information. This isn&#8217;t just about search queries but about many kinds of community information sources; what you and I see when we visit <a href="http://everyblock.com/" target="_blank">Everyblock</a> may well differ based on what we type into the text box. The only people archiving this stuff are the ones who own the databases; will the rest of us every have a look? Privacy interests say that we should not reveal it, but historians in the next century and beyond would find this absolutely crucial to their understanding of our times.</p>
<p>Happily, smarter people than yours truly are working on all of this. I&#8217;ll be filing some reports from the Washington meetings, to let you know what they&#8217;re thinking.</p>
