Games and interactivity are a large part of contemporary media and the ability to both engage with and create within this rapidly-evolving medium become more important.</p>
<p>You can see the conference&#8217;s schedule <a href="http://schedule.gdconf.com/">here</a>. Hot topics this year are social games, geolocation, smartphone applications and augmented reality. As well, something like the Serious Games summit examines the use of games for not purely entertainment reasons. So, if the GDC interests you, add suggestions for sessions or topics you&#8217;d like me to cover to the comments section.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><em>I&#8217;m speaking next week at the Guardian&#8217;s &#8220;Changing Media Summit&#8221; conference in London, and answered a Q&#038;A the media company has <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/changingmediasummit/interview-dan-gillmor">posted on the conference website</a>. Reprinting here:</em></p>
<p><strong>Which media companies, business and delivery models and platforms do you consider to be sustainable and which ones will go to the wall?<br />
</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m not nearly smart enough to tell you which companies will survive. As a (very) small shareholder in the New York Times Co., and an angel investor in <a href="http://wikia.com">several</a> <a href="http://seesmic.com">online</a> <a href="http://offbeatguides.com">startups</a>, I certainly hope they&#8217;ll be among the ones that last.</p>
<p>But some early outlines &#8212; emphasis on &#8220;early&#8221; &#8212; are beginning to emerge.</p>
<p>Media companies that persist in the industrial model of media, especially those reliant on advertising subsidies for content that has no basic relationship to what advertisers are trying to sell, are in the most jeopardy. Apart from the simple fact that advertising is being separated from content for excellent reasons, the industrial-age notion of distribution has been upended. Rather than creating content, and then publishing it on paper and putting it in trucks (or broadcasting via expensive towers or satellites), what we do now is create content and make it available; people come and get it. Only those media creators who understand the new dynamic have a chance at surviving the upheaval.</p>
<p>In the journalism sphere, I have no doubt whatever that we will replace the monopolies and oligopolies with a much more diverse and therefore more sustainable ecosystem. The enterprises will include for-profit and not-for-profit companies; and sole proprietorships and large businesses. The business models will range widely, and will be the winners from among the thousands of experiments now under way.</p>
<p>Those who can turn themselves into ecosystems in their own right &#8212; think Google, Twitter, etc. &#8212; will be major winners if they can become the center of ecosystems in which others innovate. When the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/pda/2009/mar/10/1">Guardian</a> and New York <a href="http://open.blogs.nytimes.com/tag/api/">Times</a> offer APIs to their media, they show they understand this imperative.</p>
<p><strong>What does the global media industry ten years from now look like?<br />
</strong></p>
<p>This will depend, in part, on how governments respond to the media and technology changes. If governments (urged on by law enforcement, big traditional media and especially back-facing copyright interests) restrict the ways we can use technology, we could easily see the Internet turned into a newer and only slightly more useful version of television.</p>
<p>If, on the other hand, governments allow technology and innovation to flower, we will see a media industry that dwarfs the current one in size, at least in terms of the number of people who are participating. All media will be social to one degree or another. Since information is increasingly a core feature of all products and services, media will be an even larger global industry.</p>
<p><strong>What projects are you currently engaged in on a day to day basis and how are these helping to change the face of the media and technology industries?<br />
</strong></p>
<p>I am spending my time on a variety of projects. The main one has been creating a digital media entrepreneurship program at <a href="http://cronkite.asu.edu">Arizona State University</a> in America, a project aimed at bringing an appreciation of the startup culture into the journalism curriculum. We believe students will be inventing many of their own jobs, and want to help them do so.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also continuing my long-term work on citizen media and citizen journalism. In addition, I&#8217;ve invested in or co-founded several consumer Web companies, and have new projects in the wings. Finally, I&#8217;m finishing a new book called Mediactive, a challenge to those who create and consume media to take more responsibility for what they &#8212; and we &#8212; know.</p>
<p><strong>Who do you admire in this space? Who&#8217;s inspiring you? Who&#8217;s pushing the boundaries and how?<br />
</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m inspired by so many people that I have trouble naming just a few. But I&#8217;ll start with my students, and the students I&#8217;ve met at other campuses in America and around the world. I tell them I&#8217;m jealous of their opportunities, because they will invent the future of media and journalism.</p>
<p>Allow me to offer a tip of the hat to the Guardian&#8217;s <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2010/jan/25/cudlipp-lecture-alan-rusbridger">Alan Rusbridger</a>. He is a leader of exceptional talent and vision.</p>
<p><strong>And what can we expect from you at the Changing Media Summit 2010?<br />
</strong></p>
<p>You can expect me to listen much more than I talk, though of course I&#8217;ll discuss the things I know best. I see this summit as a wonderful learning opportunity and aim to take full advantage.</p>

It&#8217;s not 100% (it didn&#8217;t catch a there/their misuse I tested), but like any proofreading support, it should be a safeguard instead of a brain replacement.

		<p>You never know when you&#8217;ll need to chop audio or upload it on the fly. For example, a laptop theft last month had me jumping from loaner machines to public PCs until I secured a suitable replacement. Web-based and low-profile apps prove their worth in such situations and I want to list a few of my favorite finds here.</p>
<p><a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/"><img class="size-full wp-image-1352 alignleft" title="Audacity" src="http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Audacity.png" alt="" width="202" height="85" /></a><a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/">Audacity</a> is the old steady when you don&#8217;t have GarageBand and you need a free audio editor. It has the backing of an enthusiastic open-source community, which keeps it regularly updated. It&#8217;s also popular with the public radio crowd as its simplicity is great for editing interviews (as opposed to remixing music). However, you must download and install it as well as download the LAME codec for the ability to export to mp3 format. This is a simple process, but a significant barrier if your current machine doesn&#8217;t offer you install privileges.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s where <a href="http://aviary.com/tools/myna">Myna</a> comes in. Part of the <a href="http://aviary.com/">Aviary</a> suite, Myna is a fully web-based audio editing tool. The features are robust and include nice editing touches like fades, control points and effects. Aviary as whole offers a community for sharing creations publicly and connecting with friends on the site. This video gives an excellent overview:</p>
<p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="480" height="295" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/_3-VWMKpQiI&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="480" height="295" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/_3-VWMKpQiI&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p>
<p><a href="http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/IndabaMusic.png"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1354" title="IndabaMusic" src="http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/IndabaMusic.png" alt="" width="353" height="213" srcset="http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/IndabaMusic.png 981w, http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/IndabaMusic-300x181.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 353px) 100vw, 353px" /></a><a href="http://www.indabamusic.com">Indaba Music</a> also offers an online audio editor, but the site&#8217;s strength is its fixation on community. The vision is to enable musicians to collaborate on music from afar. In this Colbert <a href="http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/217342/february-02-2009/dan-zaccagnino">interview</a>, Indaba&#8217;s co-founder shares an example of producing music with a friend and then bringing in vocals from a singer in Nigeria. The same scenario could easily be applied to journalism.</p>
<p>Indaba allows the user to create a Session and invite other users. Session members can then upload audio tracks to that session (adding audio via phone call is another interesting feature). When the user opens the web-based audio editor, all the tracks from that session are automatically added to the track list. Session members then see file and editing updates on their dashboard or they can subscribe to session updates via RSS. This has a lot of potential for journalists working remotely on a radio or podcasting project. Of note, is the 100mb limit for free accounts. This may not go far when dealing with long interviews. An upgrade to a 500mb account is $50/year, while unlimited storage is $250/year. Another note, the editor is java-based and in Chrome and on Mac, one must open the session file manually in Java.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to offer <a href="http://mp3cut.net/">mp3cut</a> as the ultra-simple tool for crude audio chopping in a hurry. It&#8217;s advertised as a platform for cutting clips from songs for ringtones, but could easily be used to reduce the file size of large interview when one only has one clip to worry about and only wants a small part of that clip.</p>
<p>If you have other free and easily-accessed audio tools, please share them in the comments.</p>

		<p>UPDATE: <em>The embedded VidMap was showing an error when trying to display the video. I&#8217;m looking into it, but I&#8217;ve given a link to the page where you can see the example. </em></p>
<p>Many sites now allow for quickly building your own maps and their feature sets are fairly predictable. With that in mind, I want showcase several unique features I&#8217;ve run across in mapping tools.</p>
<p><a href="http://vidmap.de/">VidMap</a> has journalistic potential. The site lets you sync video with a map, showing the aerial course of the video&#8217;s content. For example, I added <a href="http://www.vidmap.de/web/video?video_id=372">this video</a> of a trip along the Phoenix light rail and then clicked its course out on the map. When finished the video plays while a marker moves along the train&#8217;s route. This example is a bit mundane, but this would be excellent for displaying the movement of a roaming protest or showing the blocks of a neighborhood in a related story.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.vidmap.de/web/video?video_id=372" target="_blank"><img class="size-full wp-image-1342 alignnone" title="Vidmap" src="http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Vidmap.png" alt="" width="580" height="215" srcset="http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Vidmap.png 725w, http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Vidmap-300x111.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.umapper.com">UMapper</a> offers several distinctive features and one of them lets you make games out of your maps. It&#8217;s similar in style to the classic <a href="http://www.geosense.net/">Geosense</a> and its derivatives like <a href="http://www.kongregate.com/games/crafics/globetrotter-xl">Globetrotter XL</a>. This would be useful for either helping the user master locations or saying something about the relationship distance plays in a story (as distance is part of scoring). This video gives an overview:<br />
<object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="344" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/xTmSSKx8QLI&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="344" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/xTmSSKx8QLI&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p>
<p><a href="http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/UMapper_Tweet_Map.png"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1299" title="UMapper_Tweet_Map" src="http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/UMapper_Tweet_Map.png" alt="" width="256" height="200" srcset="http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/UMapper_Tweet_Map.png 427w, http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/UMapper_Tweet_Map-300x233.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px" /></a>As well, UMapper recently made it possible to create maps with Twitter results. This adds thumbnails of tweeters to a map which show the corresponding tweet if clicked. Tweet results are drawn from Twitter automatically, so the map builder doensn&#8217;t have any input in filtering results. It&#8217;s also worth noting that tweeter location can be an inexact science as only a small selection of users enable GeoTagging and results from the Location field can be all over the place. However, there may still be potential uses for building a map where tweets alongside annotated map notes creates something interesting.</p>
<p><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/micello-indoor-maps/id349747050?mt=8"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1300" title="micello" src="http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/micello.png" alt="" width="138" height="131" /></a><a href="http://www.micello.com/">Micello</a> is an application that shows maps of indoor environments. It&#8217;s relegated to just the iPhone for the moment, but this an extremely useful and untapped mapping realm. While the Micello feature set doesn&#8217;t mention shared maps at the moment, many stories happen within buildings and the potential to easily annotate floor plans with story details is an interesting one. For now, the content is primarily retail, but I&#8217;m enthusiastic about the potential.</p>
<p>What other interesting mapping tool features have you run across?</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>UPDATED</p>
<p>In the weeks since Apple announced the iPad tablet computer, the news industry and the people who watch it have been talking breathlessly about the device&#8217;s potential to help restore happier financial times to struggling journalism organizations, particularly newspapers and magazines. Perhaps the best example is <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/26/technology/26apple.html">a NY Times story</a> entitled &#8220;With Apple Tablet, Print Media Hope for a Payday,&#8221; with this quote (from an anonymous source, of course):</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Steve (Jobs) believes in old media companies and wants them to do well,&#8221; said a person who has seen the device and is familiar with Apple’s marketing plan for it, but who did not want to be named because talking about it might alienate him from the company. &#8220;He believes democracy is hinged on a free press and that depends on there being a professional press.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>This is laugh-out-loud stuff, for all kinds of reasons, not least the hilarious notion that Steve Jobs believes in a free press. This is the CEO of a company that practically defines the words &#8220;secretive&#8221; and &#8220;paranoid&#8221; &#8212; a company that <a href="http://www.eff.org/cases/apple-v-does/">took bloggers to court</a> for daring to report on what sources from inside Apple have told them about upcoming products; the threat to business journalism from that case, which thankfully Apple lost, was real and scary.</p>
<p>Steve Jobs believes in old media, all right, as long as he can absolutely dictate the terms under which old media sells (or, to be more precise, rents) its material through the Apple orifice called the iTunes Store. The music industry discovered to its dismay that Apple&#8217;s one-price-fits-all model &#8212; not to mention Apple&#8217;s control over customer information (including addresses and credit-card numbers) &#8212; was good mainly for Apple. (To be fair, the Times story did note, amid the fawning over the iPad&#8217;s media potential, that Jobs is, as the story said, a bully.)</p>
<p>The App Store, through which Apple requires iPhone application developers to sell their offerings, has its own restrictions. Apple doesn&#8217;t regulate prices, though it still disintermediates developers from their customers. The bigger issue is that Apple insists on approving every app that can be sold through the store, in an approval process that is always opaque and sometimes capricious.</p>
<p>In recent days, Apple took its control-freakery to a new level. It unilaterally <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/23/technology/23apps.html?ref=technology&amp;pagewanted=all">banned some iPhone apps</a> that, in Apple&#8217;s view, were too <em>risque</em> for its customers, including several that depicted skimpily dressed women. The company&#8217;s excuse was that some customers found the material &#8220;objectionable,&#8221; and of course Apple wanted to make its customers comfortable and happy.</p>
<p>Never mind that Apple still sells pretty much the same kinds of items through big publishers like Time Warner and Playboy. That&#8217;s mere hypocrisy, however blatant.</p>
<p>News organizations often produce material that people find objectionable. Photographs and videos of dead people in war zones and disaster aftermaths are vital to understand the scope of such events, and they are deeply upsetting to view. Publishers and broadcasters and, more recently, digital-media providers have put them out anyway. They have every right to do so, and often an journalistic obligation.</p>
<p>Apple, in the role of distributor, has every right to decide what people can sell via its online store. This is not the issue.</p>
<p>Now, journalism organizations obviously don&#8217;t have to create apps for the iPad or iPhone. They can make their material available via Web browsers.</p>
<p>But Apple won&#8217;t let Flash run on the iPhone or, it says, the iPad. While HTML5 will solve some of these issues, that new standard is early in its evolution. Meanwhile, it&#8217;s clear, news organizations believe (with some experience selling apps for the iPhone) that the user experience will be better with an app, not to mention the possibility of charging money for what they produce (though they&#8217;ll be giving Apple a cut of every transaction).</p>
<p>Ultimately, I believe, the most important issue is whether news organizations should get in bed with a company that makes unilateral and non-transparent decisions like the ones Apple has been making about content in all kinds of ways. I say they should think hard about it, and answer either in the negative or insist on iron-clad contracts with Apple that prohibit the hardware company from any kind of interference with the journalism, ever. (As Dave Winer asked in a <a href="http://twitter.com/davewiner/status/9598339791">Twitter posting</a> today, &#8220;Thought experiment: What happens to the <a href="http://engadget.com">Engadget</a> app when they run a leaked Apple announcement?&#8221; (UPDATE: And Wired quotes the Washington Post (a piece from <a href="http://www.mondaynote.com/2010/02/07/the-iparanoid-scenario/">Monday Note</a>) with <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2010/02/ipad-magazines-newspapers/">another worrisome scenario</a>.)</p>
<p>Understand, this is not about whether tablet computers are a good thing. They are. They will be a wonderful addition to the way we consumer and create media (more so the former, I&#8217;d guess), and I have no doubt that the iPad, like other Apple products, will set a new standard for ease of use and, in some ways, utility. (I&#8217;m a happy user of a Mac computer, for which Apple doesn&#8217;t restrict application developers&#8217; ability to write software.)</p>
<p>But I watch with amazement as newspaper people drool over the iPad as some kind of industry savior. They&#8217;re putting far too much trust in a company that doesn&#8217;t deserve it.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><a href="http://johndarnton.com/AboutJohn.html">John Darnton</a> is a good novelist, and was a superb journalist in a long career at the New York Times. Now he&#8217;s curator of the <a href="http://www.liu.edu/polk/">Polk Awards</a>, one of only a couple of journalism prizes that means anything. (Journalists have a tedious tendency to give themselves prizes, more so than any other business I can name.)</p>
<p>The Polk awards have been ahead of the game in recent years. Two, notably, have recognized that journalism has moved squarely into the Digital Age, even though most of the kinds of journalism achievements that win big prizes &#8212; notably investigative reports &#8212; continue to be done by organizations willing to spend serious money and devote serious time to the efforts.</p>
<p>The first pathbreaker, which falls into the category of organization-based media that happens to live on the web in this case, went to <a href="http://www.brooklyn.liu.edu/polk/press/2007.html">Josh Marshall and his team at Talking Points Memo</a> in 2007. The one making waves this year, and the more relevant here, went to the still-anonymous person who captured the video images of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/22/business/media/22polk.html">the death Neda Agha-Soltan</a> in the Iranian election protests early last year.</p>
<p>Darnton, interviewed by Mediaite, an online publication, offered left-handed compliments to the Neda video &#8212; making it entirely clear that he doesn&#8217;t really believe average people (as opposed to journalists with years of experience) have much to offer beyond bystander status. From <a href="http://www.mediaite.com/online/old-guard-news-in-the-raw/">the column</a> by Willard C. Rappleye Jr.:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;(Darnton) does take umbrage, though, against the term ‘citizen journalist.’ ‘If you’re walking down the street and somebody collapses in front of you and somebody else runs over and administers CPR because they happen to know it, and saves the victim, you wouldn’t go home and say you saw somebody saved by a citizen doctor. You’d say you saw someone saved by a bystander who happened to know CPR. Right?  ‘Same thing here. I like to call them bystanders — not journalists. Just good bystanders.’&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve long since stopped taking umbrage when people don&#8217;t get it. But to hear stuff like this from someone with Darnton&#8217;s track record is dismaying.</p>
<p>He clearly does not understand &#8212; or if he does, he deeply regrets &#8212; that journalism is no longer the province of the people like himself, who rose on well defined career tracks through a business that was comprised mostly of big monopoly organizations or a few members of an oligopoly, businesses that achieved their economic power due to conditions that no longer apply.</p>
<p>He does not get that <a href="http://mediactive.com/2009/12/28/ecosystems-and-journalism/">journalism is an ecosystem</a>, and that it is becoming more diverse over time.</p>
<p>The regular people who capture important videos and pictures &#8212; or who blog authortitatively what they&#8217;ve seen, etc. etc. etc. &#8212; are not journalists. <em>But they have committed acts of journalism, profoundly important acts of journalism.</em> That is their role &#8212; or more accurately one of their roles &#8212; in the ecosystem, and it&#8217;s becoming at least as important as any other role including the one played by the people who do it for a living or for a few freelance dollars.</p>
<p>Just as reporter shield laws (assuming we should have them) should protect journalism, not the people who are accredited or licensed to be journalists, in these awards &#8212; and in everyday life &#8212; it is the act of journalism we should be celebrating.</p>
<p>Darnton&#8217;s instincts are sound. And his wish to recognize the values of great journalism is absolutely  correct. But I hope he&#8217;ll expand his field of vision. And I hope he&#8217;ll join those of us who are working on ways to help those people he relegates to bystander roles become even more active and knowledgeable participants in the journalism sphere.</p>
<p>Citizens who commit acts of journalism: Instead of semi-sneers, they deserve our support in every possible way.</p>

		<p>Before terms like podcasting and citizen media were common, several sites and public radio storytellers were already on top of helping non-professionals tell their stories. The sites I want to list here offer great examples of what amateurs can do with a recording device and a bit of encouragement.</p>
<p><a href="http://transom.org"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1306" title="transom" src="http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/transom.png" alt="" width="319" height="185" srcset="http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/transom.png 924w, http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/transom-300x173.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 100vw, 319px" /></a><a href="http://transom.org/">Transom.org</a> is produced by <a href="http://www.atlantic.org/">Atlantic Public Media</a> and is a site for welcoming newbs into the world of public radio. In 2003, it was the first website to win a <a href="http://www.peabody.uga.edu/winners/details.php?id=1363">Peabody award</a> and did so by offering great examples of audio storytelling and solid instruction on how to produce such stories.</p>
<p><a href="http://hearingvoices.com/">HearingVoices.com</a> is a series featuring the best of public radio. It hosts its own <a href="http://hearingvoices.com/news/2007/04/hv-learn-radio-links/">&#8220;Learn Radio&#8221; list</a> with great links related to both storytelling and production.</p>
<p><a href="http://soundportraits.org/">SoundPortraits.org</a> hosts a great <a href="http://www.soundportraits.org/education/how_to_record/">Interview Checklist</a> by David Isay. Its beauty is in its brevity and would make a great pre-game rundown before interviews until you get the hang of it.</p>
<p><a href="http://radiodiaries.org"><img class="size-full wp-image-1308 alignleft" title="RadioDiaries" src="http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/RadioDiaries.bmp" alt="" width="230" height="129" /></a><a href="http://radiodiaries.org/makeyourown.html">The Teen Reporter&#8217;s Handbook</a> at <a href="http://radiodiaries.org">RadioDiaries.org</a> is another great reference for getting started in audio. As well, Radio Diaries itself is a commendable project replete with good examples of citizen storytelling. The goal of the project is to find folks whose voices are rarely heard and get a recording device in their hands to begin a personal diary. Hosted documentaries include the voices of prisoners, unique teens and carnival retirees.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re still hungry for digital storytelling links, McLellan Wyatt&#8217;s <a href="http://www.tech-head.com/dstory.htm">list</a> will keep you busy for weeks.</p>
<p>Finally, check out Ira Glass on Storytelling. He gives an excellent breakdown between merely reporting and telling a story people want to hear:</p>
