		<p>I&#8217;ve had my issues with ProPublica in the past, and haven&#8217;t changed my mind on <a href="http://mediactive.com/2009/10/01/non-profit-media-what-you-pay-for-and-who-pays/">what I said</a> back then.</p>
<p>But the organization, as I also have said, is doing brilliant work &#8212; and I don&#8217;t mean solely the <a href="http://www.propublica.org/series/deadly-choices">great stuff</a> by Sheri Fink that won a <a href="http://pulitzer.org/">Pulitzer Prize</a> today and was a finalist for <a href="http://www.propublica.org/series/nurses">another</a>.</p>
<p>Last week, ProPublica and NPR released <a href="http://www.propublica.org/feature/all-the-magnetar-trade-how-one-hedge-fund-helped-keep-the-housing-bubble">a report</a> that everyone should read and listen to. It exposed some of slimest financial dealings known to date about the financial bubble that nearly brought down the global economy: in this case, a hedge fund&#8217;s working both sides of a street in ways should make you sick, and absolutely furious.</p>
<p>Kudos to all. This is journalism at its finest.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>UPDATED</p>
<p>Recent days have reminded me of the many traits Apple and the <em>New York Times</em> share. Both are the best at what they do in certain domains. Each is emphatically elitist, and, in varying ways, self-confident to the point of arrogance. Neither is very transparent (though at least the <em>Times</em> has its <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/thepubliceditor/index.html">Public Editor</a>).</p>
<p>The differences, of course, are profound. In particular, there&#8217;s the business trajectory: Apple has reinvented itself several times, and lately has gone from triumph to triumph as a profit-making company. The Times Co.&#8217;s record in this regard is deeply mixed: Reinvention has come mostly at the edges, and the business has been heading downhill.</p>
<p>The affinities between Apple and the <em>Times</em> came into sharper focus in the past several weeks, but in ways that have raised some difficult and as-yet unanswered questions. Some background:</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<blockquote><p>Ars Technica: <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2010/04/court-throws-out-fccs-smackdown-of-comcast-p2p-blocking.ars">Court: FCC had no right to sanction Comcast for P2P blocking</a>. <em>The FCC&#8217;s decision to sanction Comcast for its 2007 P2P blocking was overruled today by the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit. The question before the court was whether the FCC had the legal authority to &#8216;regulate an Internet service provider&#8217;s network management practice.&#8217; According to a three-judge panel, &#8216;the Commission has failed to make that showing&#8217; and the FCC&#8217;s order against Comcast is tossed.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>We&#8217;re in scary territory, but it&#8217;s not a big surprise that we are.</p>
<p>Comcast and the other carriers will be emboldened to continue what they&#8217;ve started: the subjugation of America&#8217;s broadband future to their interests and those of their entertainment industry partners and subsidiaries. Our second-class status in broadband will soon be even worse if they get what they want: turning the Internet to a television-on-steroids system where control is in the middle, where the edges of the networks &#8212; that is you and me &#8212; do what the center tells us we may do.</p>
<p>The cable and phone companies have built networks from the favored position of having been government-granted monopolies. They are an effective duopoly &#8212; wireless providers can&#8217;t provide the same bandwidth and they are trapped by the oligopoly (carrier owned, to a major extent) in the backbone networks &#8212; and they are going to use it for their benefit, not ours.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t just a free-speech issue at its core. It also raises some basic economic questions; America lags further and further behind the rest of the developed world in taking advantage of broadband&#8217;s potential, and the consequences of our inaction grow more serious every year.</p>
<p>While I&#8217;m skeptical of all of the specific network-neutrality fixes I&#8217;ve seen so far &#8212; unintended consequences worry me &#8212; I&#8217;m absolutely freaked out at the trend. We are turning over our fundamental rights to communicate and collaborate to companies that have not earned even a semblance of trust.</p>
<p>The FCC&#8217;s incoherent policy-making is only partly the issue here. More important is the refusal of Congress to do its job. If only that was surprising.</p>
<p>Network neutrality has always been the kind of issue requiring serious engagement from the lawmakers. As they do so often, they&#8217;ve ducked and dodged, leaving it to regulators to make vital policy decisions.</p>
<p>Will Congress wake up? And even if it does, given our pay-to-play lawmaking environment these days, will it do the right thing? My doubts keep growing, on both counts.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/30234244@N02/3848074848/"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1441" title="thumbdrive" src="http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/thumbdrive.png" alt="USB Drive via DavidRGilson" width="202" height="157" srcset="http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/thumbdrive.png 482w, http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/thumbdrive-300x232.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 202px) 100vw, 202px" /></a>When in the field, you can be limited by computers you don&#8217;t control. Limitations can be as simple as a library computer without Adobe Reader installed or as complex as a third-world internet cafe where the machines have few applications and none in your language. A USB drive pre-loaded with your own software is a simple workaround, but I haven&#8217;t yet run across a collection of portable software packaged especially for the field journalist.</p>
<p>To meet this need, I&#8217;ve gathered a range of portable applications one can run from a USB drive. This is version 1 and will develop based on use and suggestions. I chose the initial set with this criteria in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Meet the needs of media consumption or creation</li>
<li>Open-source or freeware</li>
<li>Familiarity and ease (when possible)</li>
</ul>
<p>The how-to for setting up your own USB drive is below, but first, let me list the applications:</p>
<p><strong>Platform:</strong><br />
<a href="http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/PortableApps_Screen.png"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1438" title="PortableApps_Screen" src="http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/PortableApps_Screen.png" alt="PortableApps Screen" width="250" height="352" /></a><a href="http://portableapps.com/download"> PortableApps Platform</a> &#8211; PortableApps.com offers an extremely useful foundation for portable software. It sets up your USB drive (or even an iPod) for installing and running other portable applications. It runs on Windows, but can be run on Linux and OSX via <a href="http://www.winehq.org/" target="_blank">Wine</a>. I started with the platform alone without other applications added. However, you can download the platform with lots of extras as well.<br />
<strong> Consumption:</strong><br />
<a href="http://portableapps.com/apps/internet/firefox_portable"> Firefox</a> &#8211; Other browsers can be portable as well, but I chose Firefox for its universality.<br />
<a href="http://www.uvviewsoft.com/download.htm" target="_blank">Universal Viewer</a> &#8211; This very handy app can view most document and image types and easily covers the doc, pdf and odt bases.<br />
<a href="http://portableapps.com/apps/music_video/vlc_portable" target="_blank"> VLC Media Player</a> &#8211; VLC plays both audio files and most video formats.<br />
<strong> Creation:</strong><br />
<a href="http://portableapps.com/apps/music_video/audacity_portable" target="_blank"> Audacity</a> &#8211; This covers simple audio editing.<br />
<a href="http://portableapps.com/apps/graphics_pictures/gimp_portable" target="_blank"> GIMP</a> &#8211; This image editor is an open-source alternative to Photoshop.<br />
<a href="http://portableapps.com/apps/graphics_pictures/inkscape_portable" target="_blank"> Inkscape</a> &#8211; This vector image editor is a simple alternative to Illustrator.<br />
<a href="http://portableapps.com/apps/development/nvu_portable" target="_blank"> KompoZer</a> &#8211; Though not as robust as Dreamweaver, this web editor covers a lot of bases.<br />
<a href="http://portableapps.com/apps/development/notepadpp_portable" target="_blank"> Notepad++</a> &#8211; This is a text editor that can also highlight code. It&#8217;s useful for quick edits to HTML and CSS files.<br />
<a href="http://portableapps.com/apps/internet/filezilla_portable" target="_blank"> FileZilla</a> &#8211; This is an open-source FTP client.<br />
<a href="http://portableapps.com/apps/music_video/virtualdub_portable" target="_blank"> VirtualDub</a> &#8211; I&#8217;m still sifting through portable video-editing options, but this one should suffice for now. Codec installations in general make adding a portable video editor a bit more involved.<br />
<strong> Utilities:</strong><br />
<a href="http://portableapps.com/apps/internet/skype_portable" target="_blank"> Skype</a> &#8211; Other IM clients are available as well. Skype offers voice and is well-saturated.<br />
<a href="http://portableapps.com/apps/utilities/eraser_portable" target="_blank"> Eraser</a> &#8211; A simple privacy utility for ensuring documents erased on a public machine are gone for good.</p>
<p><strong>How to Set Up Your Field Journalist USB Drive:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>You&#8217;ll need a USB drive. It doesn&#8217;t have to be extremely roomy for applications as the total install of the programs listed here only comes to 258 MB (give or take). However, you&#8217;ll want to have room for any files you&#8217;ll be working with, so extra gigs doesn&#8217;t hurt.</li>
<li>Download the <a href="http://portableapps.com/download" target="_blank">PortableApps platform</a>. Once downloaded, run the  file. It will ask for an install location. Here, choose the drive letter of your USB drive.</li>
<li>Once installed, PortableApps should launch. If not, view the files on your USB drive and double-click &#8220;StartPortableApps.&#8221;</li>
<li> Installing applications is fairly simple, though not immediately intuitive. You first need to download the application you want to install and the files can be found at the links in the list above. There are two ways to install depending on whether the application is customized for the PortableApps platform or not. Both are simple:<br />

To install an app customized for the Portable apps platform</em>, go to &#8220;Options&#8221; and then to &#8220;Install a  New App.&#8221; Then, just select the file. Note: Files for the Portable Apps platform will carry the .PAF extension.<br />
<em><br />
To install any other portable app</em>, first download and uncompress the file. This will usually yield a file folder with that application&#8217;s name. Take this folder and copy it into the PortableApps folder on your USB drive. After this, go back to the PortableApps program, select &#8220;Options&#8221; and &#8220;Refresh App Icons.&#8221; Your new application should now appear.</li>
<li>Your USB drive is now ready for digesting, managing and editing a range of media. If you want to customize, more portable applications can be found at <a href="http://portableapps.com/apps" target="_blank">PortableApps</a> and <a href="http://www.softpedia.com/get/PORTABLE-SOFTWARE/" target="_blank">Softpedia</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is just the first version and I&#8217;m still exploring portable applications. I&#8217;m very interested in suggestions for applications you prefer to those on this initial list or programs that fill other gaps. If you know of similar projects for journalistic purposes, I&#8217;m very interested in that as well.</p>

Just enter a Flickr ID, user URL or even the e-mail address you use for Flickr and iMapFlickr will generate a Google map tagged with photo locations. The tool allows you to choose from your photo sets and offers some convenient customization options for the embedding the map elsewhere. Map dimensions, picture sizes and tag icons can all be adjusted.</p>
<p><a href="http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/iMapFlickr_map.png"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1427" title="iMapFlickr_map" src="http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/iMapFlickr_map.png" alt="iMapFlickr map" width="265" height="213" srcset="http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/iMapFlickr_map.png 551w, http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/iMapFlickr_map-300x241.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 265px) 100vw, 265px" /></a>iMapFlickr doesn&#8217;t show support for Flickr groups yet, but there is already potential here for journalistic collaborations. As long as photos are public, one can create maps from another user&#8217;s collection. So, one collaborator could upload pictures to her Flickr account and others could customize and embed the maps from that account without directly accessing it.</p>
<p>Take note that geotags have their own privacy levels on Flickr and the location data must be shared publicly for iMapFlickr to work. Check out this <a href="http://www.flickr.com/help/screencasts/vol1/">video</a> if you&#8217;re unsure how to geotag Flickr photos. Also, maps may be tricky on WordPress due to iframes. Fixes are explained <a href="http://imapflickr.com/faq.aspx">here</a>.</p>

In 2009, MobileActive received a Knight News Challenge <a href="http://newschallenge.org/winner/2009/mobile-media-toolkit">grant</a> to build the Mobile Media Toolkit, a database of tools and how-to guides for those using mobile phones for social change.</p>
<p><a href="http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/MobileActive-Mobile-Data.png"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1417" title="MobileActive Mobile Data" src="http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/MobileActive-Mobile-Data.png" alt="MobileActive Mobile Data" width="247" height="218" srcset="http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/MobileActive-Mobile-Data.png 588w, http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/MobileActive-Mobile-Data-300x264.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 247px) 100vw, 247px" /></a>Part of this toolkit is a <a href="http://mobileactive.org/mobiledata">directory</a> of mobile phone statistics that functions as something like a CIA factbook for mobile. Selecting a country, one can see mobile costs, saturation amongst the population and regional providers. For example, I can see that around 41% of Chinese citizens use mobile phones and they pay about 1 US cent on average for an SMS (as of 2007-2008). This is helpful data as one decides how to develop applications for different regions of the world.</p>
<p>As well, MobileActive offers a <a href="http://mobileactive.org/directory">database</a> of mobile phone applications, case studies and how-to guides. These range in purpose from citizen media to advocacy and are extremely fresh with most additions occurring in 2009-2010.</p>
<p>Finally, MobileActive&#8217;s sense of purpose emerges in its news about global uses of mobile. Recent articles tell stories about a 20-village <a href="http://mobileactive.org/pick-phone-news-calling">news network</a> in rural India and  anonymous cell phone <a href="http://mobileactive.org/anonymous-cell-phone-video-wins-journalism-award">videos</a> from Iran. Katrin Verclas, MobileActive&#8217;s co-founder, expresses the heart behind the project in this video:</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><img src="http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Screen-shot-2010-03-20-at-10.20.40-AM.png" border="0" alt="Screen shot 2010-03-20 at 10.20.40 AM.png" width="151" height="35" align="right" />Politico, the website devoted to all things political, almost certainly got <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pwn">pwned</a> by scam artists Friday when it posted an unverified memo &#8212; a probable hoax &#8212; about health care. It&#8217;s an embarrassment for journalists who fall for fakery, but these kinds of things do happen.</p>
<p>What doesn&#8217;t usually happen is how Politico dealt with its inadequate journalism. And the case brought back memories of another, more significant mess: the &#8220;Rathergate&#8221; affair of 2004; more on that below.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s obvious, if you read the <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0310/34728.html"><em>non mea culpa</em></a> posted by Political&#8217;s White House editor, Craig Gordon, that his organization didn&#8217;t check the memo&#8217;s authenticity before putting it online, and only pulled it down after Democrats complained. But instead simply apologizing forthrightly, he basically said a) Politico now couldn&#8217;t verify anything about the memo&#8217;s authenticity; b) but it <em>seemed</em> real (as if that&#8217;s an excuse; c) and besides, the Democrats were probably doing what the memo said they were doing anyway.</p>
<p>Then comes his conclusion, a howler for a journalist:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;In the end, POLITICO followed an old rule-of-thumb in journalism in taking down the memo: when in doubt, leave it out. By day’s end, it was still impossible to tell exactly what’s the real story behind the memo. But in the next few months, when Democrats try to pass a multi-billion-dollar ‘doc fix,’ maybe that will shed a little light on the Democrats’ real intentions.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Except that &#8220;leave it out&#8221; is not synonymous with &#8220;publish it and then take it down if we learn later that we can&#8217;t verify its authenticity&#8221; &#8212; or is this the news standard for news organizations boasting a co-founder who serves on the Pulitzer Prize governing board?</p>
<p>The standard Politico has applied here, is, of course, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truthiness">&#8220;truthiness&#8221;</a>: Because they want it to be true, it&#8217;s close enough.</p>
<p>To be more fair to Politico than the publication may deserve, the memo seemed to many others like something some Democratic aide, somewhere in Washington, <em>might</em> have written, perhaps as a draft. This helps explain why so many journalists took the bait and became part of the vast spin machine that so defines our nation&#8217;s political press.</p>
<p>As Talking Points Memo&#8217;s Christina Bellantoni <a href="http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2010/03/doc-fix-tick-tock-where-did-the-memo-come-from.php?ref=fpblg">reports</a>, the Atlantic&#8217;s Marc Ambinder had the <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2010/03/here-i-will-discuss-the-memo-i-posted/37773">honor to apologize</a> for posting without checking. The Hill, a publication with apparently more traditional principles, got the memo but <a href="http://twitter.com/MPOTheHill/status/10736362232">decided not to run it</a> at all.</p>
<p>Remember, just a few years ago the journalism and political worlds went appropriately berserk when CBS&#8217; 60 Minutes II team ran a story about George W. Bush&#8217;s &#8220;service&#8221; in the Air National Guard. The report was based, in part <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killian_documents_controversy">on memoranda</a> that CBS not only couldn&#8217;t prove were authentic but which were at best highly questionable as to their authenticity. The journalism was awful; CBS and its people took a deserved hit to their reputations. Sadly &#8212; and I use that word partly because the journalists involved had long and outstanding records for doing great work &#8212; the people who made the mistakes <a href="http://www.poynter.org/content/content_view.asp?id=76700">held fast</a> to the notion that they&#8217;d done nothing wrong.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s obvious, based on the verifiable record, that Bush got strings pulled to avoid Vietnam service and then all but ducked out on his duty. And it may turn out that some Democrat&#8217;s fingerprints are on the health care memo. In both cases, the journalism was lacking, and the journalists&#8217; response even more so.</p>
<p>Politico is widely considered a new gold standard of political reporting. That worries me.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Last week I attended the <a href="http://www.gdconf.com/">Game Developers Conference</a> and kept my eyes open for topics related to media literacy. Thoughts on media consumption and creation show up in the multitude of lectures, panels, bootcamps and roundtables dedicated to the study and creation of games. Here are some things I gleaned:</p>
<p><strong>Serious Games Summit</strong><br />
<a href="http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/gerrymander.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-1385 alignright" title="gerrymander" src="http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/gerrymander.png" alt="Redistricting Game" width="236" height="182" srcset="http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/gerrymander.png 820w, http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/gerrymander-300x230.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 236px) 100vw, 236px" /></a>Several interesting things came up at the Serious Games Summit, which is the session track for examining games used for purposes other than entertainment (not that entertainment isn&#8217;t a worthy goal itself). Here are the highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Soren Johnson contrasted game theme with mechanic in a talk titled &#8220;Theme is not meaning.&#8221; This is an important breakdown when it comes to games literacy as game mechanics tend to deliver the real meaning in a game. Johnson&#8217;s thesis was that a game&#8217;s window dressing was just that unless the mechanic matched. The <a href="http://redistrictinggame.org/">Redistricting Game</a> was offered of a solid example of matching theme with mechanic as the player is tasked with literally drawing new voting district lines to win needed votes. The discussion goes much deeper and Chris Dahlen writes more about the talk <a href="http://www.edge-online.com/features/gdc-mechanics-are-everything">here</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.plushapocalypse.com/borut/?page_id=3">Borut Pfeifer</a> has been working on a game about crowds in the Iranian Election. Named <em><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1566255659/video-game-set-in-iran-during-the-post-election-ri-0">The Unconcerned</a></em>, the game pulls the player through the streets of the Iranian election by putting her in the shoes of parents looking for their daughter. Pfeifer&#8217;s talk covered prototyping and the many iterations along the way to figuring out what played well. The biggest takeaway here concerns creation. Traditionally, creating media involved getting one&#8217;s ducks in a neat row before creation began. However, games and other digital media find success in testing and getting feedback on many rough drafts along the way. I&#8217;m going to hunt down some links for the best practices for iterative design for the <a href="http://mediactive.com/resources/tools/">Mediactive Tools</a> section.</li>
<li>While the talk strayed more into digital entrepreneurship, <a href="http://www.micro-enterprise-institute.org/?page=mea_i_board">Jelena Godjevac</a> presented a case study of <a href="http://www.get-it-city.net/">Blossom</a>, a game that places the player in the role of a small business owner. Blossom came out of Micro Enterprise Acceleration Institute (MEA-I) as a game-based way of furthering local micro-business. They&#8217;re looking for new ideas for games that teach entrepreneurship and are teaming up with HP in a <a href="http://www.get-it-city.net/sgcompetition/">design contest</a>. I&#8217;d love to see submissions related to digital media entrepreneurs, like starting a local news site or training citizen journalists.</li>

<p><strong>Game Writers&#8217; Roundtable</strong><br />
Several worthwhile tips came out of a roundtable of both professional and amateur game writers. Here are the ones that apply well to digital media creation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Show don&#8217;t tell &#8211; In an interactive environment, show a story before using words. Figure out what you can say with other forms of media. This applies to even something like blogs. Can you set your stage with a good photo or video? Does a link or a podcast say it better than you can?</li>
<li>If you can&#8217;t tweet it, you shouldn&#8217;t write it &#8211; This came up in the context of dialogue and text in midst of play. The same could be applied to captions, explanations of mashups and even one&#8217;s YouTube video descriptions. There are excellent uses for long form, but if your creation is multimedia, don&#8217;t burden it with text. Err on the side of brevity.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Farmville</strong><br />
Social games were a hot topic at the GDC this year, both for the massive jump in people playing these games and for their lucrative nature. I sat in on a session with <a href="http://markskaggs.com/">Mark Skaggs</a> of <a href="http://www.farmville.com/">Farmville</a> where he explained the game&#8217;s development process. Farmville itself has been a bit of a <a href="http://blog.games.com/2010/03/11/farmville-wins-best-new-social-online-game-at-the-game-developer/">phenomenon</a> and a rather <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2009/10/31/scamville-the-social-gaming-ecosystem-of-hell/">controversial</a> one.</p>
<p>Most interesting for Mediactive&#8217;s purposes are the rapid creation and development of Farmville. According to Skaggs, the initial team was composed of less than ten people and was developed in five weeks. From the point of release, the game acquired about 1,000,000 new users per week, an above-expectations rate. This critical mass gave the team lots of data, which informed the design going forward. Skaggs explained &#8220;fun&#8221; as something hard to measure, while behavior could be tracked by clicks. When strawberries received a large number of clicks, the team created &#8220;Super Berries&#8221; and the resulting popularity nearly crashed the server. This is just one example, but every game action and click was evaluated for new direction in content.</p>
<p>I see a couple lessons here that apply to digital media:</p>
<ol>
<li>Release quickly and design based on data and user feedback.</li>
<li>Data-driven design requires greater discussion when it comes to news. Lots of clicks can tell you if a story is popular, but a click can&#8217;t tell you if the reader was informed. As well, a click may tell a creator if people enjoy content, but not the impact of that content. For example, a reader may spend more clicks in a day on what celebrities are wearing, but one click given to a long form political story may have the greatest impact on a future vote.</li>
</ol>
<p>Beyond what I&#8217;ve covered here. I ran into some interesting tools for media creation, which I&#8217;ll be testing and posting to the Tools page. Games and interactive environments are ripe for experimentation when it comes to new media and I&#8217;m excited to see what emerges over time.</p>
