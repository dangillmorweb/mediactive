	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><em>This article was originally </em><a href="http://www.salon.com/technology/dan_gillmor/2010/09/17/zuckerberg_and_character/index.html" target="_blank"><em>published</em></a><em> on Salon on September 17, 2010.</em></p>
<p>It&#8217;s as famous a story now as the founding of Microsoft, only we&#8217;re talking about the latest rule-the-world tech start-up: As a Harvard student, Mark Zuckerberg launched the company that will soon make him the richest 20-something of all time, the prime shareholder in a company that may have more influence on our society than any other in the online world.</p>
<p>But as <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/09/20/100920fa_fact_vargas?currentPage=all" target="_blank">this week&#8217;s profile</a> in the New Yorker confirms, Facebook&#8217;s CEO was a nasty piece of work in college. As Jose Antonio Vargas writes, referring to instant messages that were found on Zuckerberg&#8217;s computer as he and lawyers prepared to defend against a claim (settled for $65 million) that he stole the idea for the site and prevented the originators from launching theirs:</p>
<blockquote><p>Although the IMs did not offer any evidence to support the claim of theft, according to sources who have seen many of the messages, the IMs portray Zuckerberg as backstabbing, conniving, and insensitive. A small group of lawyers and Facebook executives reviewed the messages, in a two-hour meeting in January, 2006, at the offices of Jim Breyer, the managing partner at the venture-capital firm Accel Partners, Facebook’s largest outside investor.</p>
<p>The technology site Silicon Alley Insider got hold of some of the messages and, this past spring, posted the transcript of a conversation between Zuckerberg and a friend, outlining how he was planning to deal with Harvard Connect:</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>FRIEND: so have you decided what you are going to do about the websites?</p>
<p>ZUCK: yea i’m going to fuck them</p>
<p>ZUCK: probably in the year</p>
<p>ZUCK: *ear</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>In another exchange leaked to <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/embarrassing-and-damaging-zuckerberg-ims-confirmed-by-zuckerberg-the-new-yorker-2010-9" target="_blank">Silicon Alley Insider</a>, Zuckerberg explained to a friend that his control of Facebook gave him access to any information he wanted on any Harvard student:</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>ZUCK: yea so if you ever need info about anyone at harvard</p>
<p>ZUCK: just ask</p>
<p>ZUCK: i have over 4000 emails, pictures, addresses, sns</p>
<p>FRIEND: what!? how’d you manage that one?</p>
<p>ZUCK: people just submitted it</p>
<p>ZUCK: i don’t know why</p>
<p>ZUCK: they “trust me”</p>
<p>ZUCK: dumb fucks</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to make too much of these kinds of things, and vitally important that we all recognize that we all do and say stupid things when we&#8217;re kids. But the cool, contemptuous arrogance in these IMs tells you a great deal about who this person was at the time.</p>
<p>Now he&#8217;s a few years older, and publicly regretting what he said (if not what he did) as a slightly younger man when, if Vargas&#8217; anonymous sources can be believed (and the IMs we have seen don&#8217;t make us doubt), Zuckerman said &#8220;backstabbing, conniving, and insensitive&#8221; things. The question is whether we can trust him today. I want to believe that Zuckerberg has a) surrounded himself with enough people who have integrity; and b) has grown up, a lot. That&#8217;s a big leap, unfortunately, given the way Facebook constantly pushes changes in the terms of its deal with users, especially the way it pushes people to publish more and more of their most personal information.</p>
<p>The New Yorker piece, which does begin to humanize the Facebook chief, uncoincidentally hit the streets just days before the debut of an already well-known film about the early days of Facebook. The magazine&#8217;s piece quotes screenwriter Aaron Sorkin calling the picture a story about &#8220;a group of, in one way or another, socially dysfunctional people who created the world’s great social-networking site.&#8221;</p>
<p>Peter Kafka, who writes about media for the Wall Street Journal&#8217;s All Things Digital site, has seen it and starts <a href="http://mediamemo.allthingsd.com/20100913/the-social-network-is-just-as-brutal-as-mark-zuckerberg-feared/" target="_blank">his piece this way</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s hard to feel sorry for a billionaire. But here I am, feeling bad for Mark Zuckerberg. If you see &#8220;The Social Network&#8221; you’re probably going to feel bad for him, too.</p>
<p>I saw a screening of the movie last week, and can report back that it’s just as rough on the Facebook CEO as his people feared it would be.</p></blockquote>
<p>Anyone who sees the film should have something clearly in mind: Some of it is pure fiction, as it&#8217;s based on a <a href="http://www.randomhouse.com/catalog/display.pperl/9780385529372.html" target="_blank">book</a> whose author admits this, as Kafka notes. The thing is, we can&#8217;t be sure which part.</p>
<p>On that score, I also feel compassion for Zuckerberg. Sadly, people have a habit of going to biopics and pictures &#8220;based on a true story&#8221; and believing they&#8217;ve witnessed actual history. I don&#8217;t blame the filmmakers &#8212; this is a deep cultural flaw &#8212; but there&#8217;s something truly ugly about the way Hollywood takes liberties with history without prominently labeling the work as, say, possible truth or probable fiction.</p>
<p>Zuckerberg has told interviewers he doesn&#8217;t plan to see the movie. I hope, assuming he really doesn&#8217;t, that he&#8217;ll use the couple of hours to contemplate his outsize role in our world today, and likely tomorrow. Facebook is an awesome force at this point, and it&#8217;s still not clear that the company is being run by honorable grown-ups.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><em>This article was originally <a href="http://www.salon.com/technology/dan_gillmor/2010/09/12/microsoft_enables_russian_repression/index.html" target="_blank">published</a> on Salon on September 12, 2010.</em></p>
<p>Despots use the law to repress their citizens. The laws can be evil as written, or they can be so widely flouted that selective enforcement punishes the &#8220;right&#8221; people.</p>
<p>The Russian government has deployed the latter tactic, the New York Times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/12/world/europe/12raids.html?_r=2&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;adxnnlx=1284321640-2fx3e/0K0LQZyZ1yCoRWjg" target="_blank">reports today</a>, by using a law against copyright infringement to go after dissidents. That&#8217;s bad enough. What should sicken Americans is that Microsoft is complicit in this campaign, according to the newspaper:</p>
<blockquote><p>Across Russia, the security services have carried out dozens of similar raids against outspoken advocacy groups or opposition newspapers in recent years. Security officials say the inquiries reflect their concern about software piracy, which is rampant in Russia. Yet they rarely if ever carry out raids against advocacy groups or news organizations that back the government.</p>
<p>As the ploy grows common, the authorities are receiving key assistance from an unexpected partner: Microsoft itself. In politically tinged inquiries across Russia, lawyers retained by Microsoft have staunchly backed the police.</p>
<p>Interviews and a review of law enforcement documents show that in recent cases, Microsoft lawyers made statements describing the company as a victim and arguing that criminal charges should be pursued. The lawyers rebuffed pleas by accused journalists and advocacy groups, including Baikal Wave, to refrain from working with the authorities. Baikal Wave, in fact, said it had purchased and installed legal Microsoft software specifically to deny the authorities an excuse to raid them. The group later asked Microsoft for help in fending off the police. “Microsoft did not want to help us, which would have been the right thing to do,” said Marina Rikhvanova, a Baikal Environmental Wave co-chairwoman and one of Russia’s best-known environmentalists. “They said these issues had to be handled by the security services.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The company put out <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/12/world/europe/12side-raids.html" target="_blank">a statement</a> saying it would be looking into the situation and, if the company is to be trusted, to rein in its Russian legal team, among other actions. Believe this when you see it.</p>
<p>Microsoft isn&#8217;t alone in going beyond the standard tech-industry assistance for foreign repression. Typically this takes the form of obeying legal but odious orders from local authorties, as Yahoo did in China&#8217;s jailing of a dissident, an act for which it belatedly (and somewhat unconvincingly) <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/07/business/worldbusiness/07iht-yahoo.1.8226586.html" target="_blank">apologized</a>. Two years ago, Business Week published a<a href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/06_38/b4001067.htm" target="_blank">long and dreary list</a> of U.S. companies that believe authoritarian rule makes for good markets.</p>
<p>What Microsoft seems to have done in Russia is disturbing in new ways, an overt and unusually slimy collaboration with tactics plainly aimed at stamping out dissent. Could the company be sending a more troubling message about its ethics and corporate culture? It&#8217;s hard to imagine a more ugly one.</p>
<p>I find myself hoping that top Microsoft executives such as Steve Ballmer and Ray Ozzie had no idea what was being done with their company&#8217;s help. The public statement is weasly and insufficient.</p>
<p>I hope these men will look in the mirror tomorrow morning, after the justified PR firestorm heading their way in the wake of the Times story, and realize how bad this is. And when they get to the office, I hope they&#8217;ll announce something better: their intention to crack down on the people who made this happen, at least the ones under their own control.</p>

		<p><em>This article was originally <a href="http://www.salon.com/technology/dan_gillmor/2010/09/08/google_instant/index.html" target="_blank">published</a> on Salon on September 8, 2010.</em></p>
<p>Calling Google Instant &#8220;revolutionary,&#8221; as its creators did when they<a href="http://www.google.com/instant/#utm_campaign=launch&amp;utm_medium=van&amp;utm_source=instant" target="_blank">launched it today</a>, seems a bit much. Actually more than a bit &#8212; but I&#8217;m definitely going to be using it.</p>
<p>This is more than a new feature. It&#8217;s a clever and useful upgrade of Google&#8217;s fundamental search technology, turning the search page into something considerably more interactive than it&#8217;s been and offering real time-savings. The long-range implications are even more intriguing, as I&#8217;ll note below.</p>
<p>First, let&#8217;s look at what it does: You start typing in the search box. As you type you get instant results that Google suggests, based on what people searching for information have done in the past. Google predicts what you&#8217;re looking for and shows results below the search box. A drop-down list from the search box gives you alternatives, and as you select each the results below shift to reflect that choice.</p>
<p>This is powerful stuff, and not just because it&#8217;ll save time. It will, from two to five seconds per search, said Marissa Mayer, the Google executive who introduced the product and the team that created it. Do some multiplication &#8212; billions upon billions of searches &#8212; and it starts adding up to serious time.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a different character to the way we search. We read faster than we type, and Instant uses the best elements of our human ability to scan text rapidly. The combination is a considerably more interactive search page, including what shows up below.</p>
<p>You need a modern browser &#8212; Chrome, Firefox, Safari or IE 8 &#8212; to use Google Instant, and it isn&#8217;t working everywhere even in the U.S. yet. The rollout will continue, first to Europe and then to the rest of the world.</p>
<p>A mobile version will arrive later this fall. I&#8217;m assuming it&#8217;ll hit Android phones first.</p>
<p>Other thoughts, and implications:</p>
<ul>
<li>People will be using Google&#8217;s home page a lot more, at least until Google and the browser companies find ways &#8212; assuming they want to &#8212; to create popover windows that create roughly the same effect while not leaving the page we&#8217;re already on. Google is &#8220;working on it,&#8221; said Mayer.</li>
<li>You have to be logged in to use Instant. This means Google is going to get even more personal information from you; if you don&#8217;t think what you search for is highly personal you&#8217;re not paying attention. (UPDATE: I should have noted that while you have to log in to use it, you can also turn it off.)</li>
<li>Google takes a nannyish approach to what you are allowed to see. The first letters of words that are deemed violent, hateful or pornographic won&#8217;t produce instant feedback; you have to click the search button to find what you&#8217;re looking for. This creates an obvious problem. Google should give users an easy way to turn this off. The more people use this, the more Google is making decisions for us that it should let <em>us</em> be making &#8212; and a search product with this kind of market dominance shouldn&#8217;t have that power.</li>
<li>Over time, Google will surely learn more about what you and I want as individuals. So I&#8217;m guessing that the results it&#8217;ll show me will, more and more, differ from the ones it shows you. Is this a good thing or not? I&#8217;m not certain.</li>
<li>What all this means to search-based advertising and SEO &#8212; search engine optimization, what websites do to be more easily found by Google, Bing and other search products &#8212; is unclear. But consider this, for starters: The second page of Google results, and maybe even the bottom of the first page, is going to be much less relevant. If that doesn&#8217;t change the nature of search, and advertising based on search, nothing will.</li>
<li>If you&#8217;re the first brand or concept to pop up when someone types a letter &#8212; e.g. &#8220;b&#8221; gives you Bank of America (ugh) &#8212; you are an example of the SEO rich getting richer. These are the same results that showed up in popdown menus before, but Google is now guiding you, with the visual results below, to the top choices. This is a powerful feedback loop.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;ll update as I learn more. I&#8217;ll also scan the Web for the best analysis I can find on this and post links below.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><em>This article was <a href="http://www.salon.com/technology/dan_gillmor/2010/08/31/washington_post_errors_continue/index.html" target="_blank">originally published</a> on Salon on August 31, 2010.</em></p>
<p>The Washington Post&#8217;s ombudsman, Andrew Alexander, took aim in his<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/08/27/AR2010082703803_pf.html" target="_blank">Sunday column</a> at the kinds of small errors and sloppiness that torpedo trust in a media institution. He began:</p>
<blockquote><p>A single major error can damage a news organization. But incessant lesser ones can be more harmful. Like a cancer, they gradually destroy credibility and eventually sever the organization&#8217;s bond of trust with its audience.</p></blockquote>
<p>True enough, and as Alexander noted, the Post is getting more and more complaints about these mistakes. Whether it&#8217;s due to understaffing or burnout or something else, he said, &#8220;if this error-prone process is the new normal, it&#8217;s testing the loyalty of readers at a time when The Post desperately needs them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Because I spent years in the middle of the newspaper-making process, I have a fair amount of tolerance for small mistakes &#8212; typos and such &#8212; that are obviously related to time pressures. They&#8217;re very unfortunate, but they happen. In a digital world, they&#8217;re more manageable, because a swift correction can ensure that subsequent readers won&#8217;t see the goof, thereby limiting the damage.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a lot less tolerant of a persistent refusal to correct mistakes, especially when they are not trivial. And as Alexander himself observed in <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/12/04/AR2009120403075.html" target="_blank">a piece last December</a>, the paper too often moves at a &#8220;snail&#8217;s pace&#8221; even after being notified.</p>
<p>In some cases, the snail seems to have died. A case in point is a flagrantly erroneous editorial written last October, on the day the <a href="http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/joan_walsh/politics/2009/10/10/obama_nobel_prize">Nobel Peace Prize folks</a> announced they were giving President Obama the 2009 award.</p>
<p>Critics said the prize in this case, or at least at that juncture in Obama&#8217;s career, was a mistake, and the Post&#8217;s editorial board plainly agreed (as did I). But in making that point, the editorial writer undermined it. The writer said the prize <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/10/09/AR2009100903860.html" target="_blank">should have gone</a> instead to <a href="http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2009/06/24/photos">Neda Agha-Soltan</a>, the Iranian woman who was shot and killed during the post-election protests in Iran earlier in 2009.</p>
<p>As many people, including the Atlantic&#8217;s Jim Fallows, <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2009/10/dont-these-people-have-the-google/28222/" target="_blank">pointed out</a>, the only way to receive the prize posthumously is to die after the announcement that you&#8217;ve won. It&#8217;s in the rules and explained in the Nobel site&#8217;s <a href="http://nobelprize.org/contact/faq/index.html" target="_blank">FAQ</a>.</p>
<p>I asked Alexander about this last October, and he said he forwarded my query to the editorial page editor. I got no further response, and the piece remains unchanged. I&#8217;m sorry to say that doesn&#8217;t surprise me anymore, because of where the error occurred: on the editorial page.</p>
<p>Despite its recent declines the Post remains one of America&#8217;s best newspapers, in part for brilliant work like its recent (and lamentably unheralded) series on our burgeoning <a href="http://projects.washingtonpost.com/top-secret-america/" target="_blank">culture of official secrecy</a>.</p>
<p>But what makes the Post still worth reading is its news pages. They are separate from the editorial page operation, which is a notably weak part of the overall product. If you took an equal number of random Washington, D.C., citizens off the street and gave them the job of running the newspaper&#8217;s editorial and op-ed pages, you could hardly do worse. You might well do better.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><em>This article was <a href="http://www.salon.com/technology/dan_gillmor/2010/08/26/who_is_a_journalist/index.html" target="_blank">originally published</a> on Salon on August 26, 2010.</em></p>
<h3>What should we call the people who are creating valuable new information in the new-media ecosystem?</h3>
<p>If you&#8217;re a creator of media, and most of us are these days in one way or another, what should I call you?</p>
<p>Why do I ask? I&#8217;m finishing up a new book, called  &#8220;Mediactive,&#8221; to be published this fall. My primary goals are to persuade people to become much more active users, not passive consumers, of media. Part of this is what we&#8217;ve traditionally called &#8220;media literacy&#8221; &#8212; among other things, applying critical thinking to what we consume. And because we are all becoming creators in the Digital Age, it also means we need to apply some basic principles so people will trust what we say (assuming we want to be trusted).</p>
<p>One of my dilemmas has been what to call these new trusted media creators. In the era of scarcity, when there were relatively few outlets, many of them were called &#8220;journalists.&#8221;</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t only my problem, and it&#8217;s more than just semantics. Asking the question in the right way has real-world impacts. So-called <a href="http://www.citmedialaw.org/state-shield-laws" target="_blank">shield laws</a>, for example, aim to protect whistle-blowers and the journalists whom they tell about government or corporate wrongdoing. Some states specify who counts as a journalist, which leaves out a huge range of people who effectively practice journalism nowadays; it also encourages a pernicious, back-door licensing of journalists. The right approach, if we need shield laws at all, is to protect acts of journalism.</p>
<p>As digital media become ubiquitous and more and more of us communicate and collaborate online, every person is capable of doing something that has journalistic value. Quite reasonably, relatively few of these folks imagine themselves as journalists, and they&#8217;d laugh if you called them one.</p>
<p>Suppose you spot a couple of items online that you want me and other people interested in, say, folk music to see. You forward the links, along with short excerpts and a brief comment explaining why these items are worthwhile, to a mail list. If I tell you, &#8220;That was an act of journalism: You curated, aggregated, wrote commentary and created meta-data,&#8221; your response, appropriately, will be, &#8220;Huh? I was just forwarding some links.&#8221;</p>
<p>﻿One reason for our terminology deficit, notes <a href="http://shirky.com/" target="_blank">Clay Shirky</a>, a friend and author of the brilliant new book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cognitive-Surplus-Creativity-Generosity-Connected/dp/1594202532?tag=saloncom08-20" target="_blank">&#8220;Cognitive Surplus: Creativity and Generosity in a Connected Age,&#8221;</a> is the end of the era when we &#8220;assumed that the ability to speak in public was owned by an elite class.&#8221; Words like &#8220;entertainer&#8221; and &#8220;journalist&#8221; belonged to vocations and professions.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the words that do apply to large groups &#8212; consumer, audience, customer, etc. &#8212; have taken on largely passive connotations, for the good reason that these have been largely passive activities. In the mass media world, you take them or leave them, and that&#8217;s it.</p>
<p>Another issue: The word &#8220;journalist&#8221; carries baggage. The journalism business has fallen on hard times for reasons beyond the loss of advertising revenue. Epic failure to do our jobs &#8212; Iraq and the financial bubble are Exhibits A and B for the past decade &#8212; combined with an obsession for sensational, trivial topics has contributed to plummeting respect the public has for the craft.</p>
<p>I share some disdain for the word. When I was a reporter I called myself a reporter. When I was a columnist I called myself a columnist. Calling myself a journalist, which I did from time to time, tended to make me feel like I was pretending to a higher role than the craft, however vital and honorable it may be, merited.</p>
<p>&#8211; &#8211; &#8211; &#8211; &#8211; &#8211; &#8211; &#8211;</p>
<p>People often ask who, in the anyone-can-publish world, is a journalist? I tell them it&#8217;s the wrong question. The right one: What is journalism?</p>
<p>﻿The mass media creations of the New York Times qualify as journalism. Ditto BBC News. Sometimes they get things wrong, even badly wrong, but they do journalism by any standard.</p>
<p>I hope we can agree that the <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=blah+blah+blah+blog&amp;btnG=Search" target="_blank">Blah Blah Blah</a> blog (actually there are a bunch with that name) and the YouTube video of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GbJbXJPUYY" target="_blank">“Nat and Foxy disco dancing”</a> are not journalism. Now, they may be interesting to their undoubtedly small audiences, and we should celebrate their existence to the extent that we celebrate (as I do) any act of hands-on media creation. They just aren&#8217;t journalism. (Nat &amp; Foxy do look like they&#8217;re having a good time.)</p>
<p>Now consider <a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/" target="_blank">Talking Points Memo</a>, founded by Joshua Micah Marshall. It&#8217;s online only, and it has a politically left-of-center worldview. It&#8217;s also unquestionably journalism.</p>
<p>Dig deeper into into new media, and the answer starts to get complicated. ﻿</p>
<p><a href="http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/" target="_blank">Brad DeLong</a>, a former Clinton administration Treasury Department official, teaches at U.C.-Berkeley and writes a blog about economics and policy. He does something that surely looks like journalism: commentary informed by knowledge. What about the bloggers who write on Lisa Stone&#8217;s BlogHer network? There&#8217;s a great deal of journalistic value in what they create.</p>
<p>My old neighborhood in Silicon Valley had a Yahoo mailing list where people talked about the community. Some of what appeared there was journalism by any standard I can apply the word. Most wasn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>A Facebook wall? It&#8217;s news to someone, right? Flickr photos? YouTube videos? Adding a location to someone else&#8217;s map?</p>
<p>On Christmas Day 2009, as a blizzard pounded Oklahoma, its residents posted local road conditions and information about where stranded travelers could hunker down with local families. If that can’t be called journalism in a traditional sense, it’s certainly more useful to a family in a sedan on the side of the road than any roundup story by a news organization during the storm.</p>
<p>&#8211; &#8211; &#8211; &#8211; &#8211; &#8211; &#8211; &#8211; &#8211; &#8211;</p>
<p>We are all creating media. Any one of us can, and many of us will, commit an act of journalism. We may contribute to the journalism ecosystem once, rarely, frequently or constantly. How we deal with these contributions &#8212; deciding to try one, what we do with what we’ve created, and how the rest of us use what’s been created &#8212; is going to be complex and evolving. But it’s the future.</p>
<p>Back to the earlier issue: Do we need a new name for the modern media creators, specifically the ones who are creating information of value to communities (of geography or interest)? I&#8217;d like to find one but I confess I&#8217;m not having an easy time of it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Creator&#8221; has its own baggage. &#8220;Participant&#8221; and &#8220;collaborator&#8221; and &#8220;contributor&#8221; don&#8217;t seem exactly right, either.</p>
<p>If you have any ideas, I&#8217;d love to hear them.</p>

		<p><em>This article was </em><a href="http://www.salon.com/technology/dan_gillmor/2010/08/25/music_industry_wants_more_control/index.html" target="_blank"><em>originally published</em></a><em> on Salon on August 25, 2010.</em></p>
<h3>Not satisfied with our current Draconian rules, the copyright cartel aims for absolute power</h3>
<p>In the surely-you&#8217;re-joking category, here comes the music industry to say it needs even tougher copyright rules. Sorry, no joke.</p>
<p>As CNET&#8217;s <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-20014468-38.html" target="_blank">Declan McCullagh reports</a> from a conference in Aspen, Colo., Cary Sherman, president of the Recording Industry Association of America, complained about &#8220;loopholes&#8221; in the current copyright system. But what he calls loopholes are among the few parts of the law that remotely temper the absolute control that the RIAA and its allies, mainly in the movie business, want copyright holders to have over everything digital.</p>
<p>Specifically, the entertainment industry is looking to enforce copyright by getting third parties to do some of the dirty work. In particular, the industry wants companies such as search engines and Internet service providers &#8212; the latter is typically your phone or cable company &#8212; to keep an eagle eye on what you do with your own computer, inspecting what you download and upload in granular ways. This is the rough equivalent of getting your phone company to listen to your calls to make sure you aren&#8217;t planning anything illegal.</p>
<p>The way the entertainment companies are trying to make this kind of thing work in other countries is to get ISPs to <a href="http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,5848242,00.html?maca=en-rss-en-all-1573-rdf" target="_blank">shut down users&#8217; access</a> after accusations of infringing behavior, with harder punishments also a possibility. A legal battle royal is under way in France and the European Union over this insane policy.</p>
<p>What the cartel wants, essentially, is to make all the decisions about how what it produces may be used in any way. This flies in the face of tradition and law, and would inevitably lead to a regime under which we would all need permission to use digital content for any purpose whatsoever.</p>
<p>As Internet access consolidates into the hands of a few companies, these threats become more serious, not so much because the ISPs want to be spying on you but rather because they may be forced to do so. Let your ISP know you won&#8217;t be happy if this happens.</p>

		<p><em>This article was </em><a href="http://www.salon.com/technology/dan_gillmor/2010/08/23/jailbreaking_android_phones/index.html" target="_blank"><em>originally published</em></a><em> on Salon on August 23, 2010.</em></p>
<h3>As Google gives carriers more sway over the operating system, customers need more options</h3>
<p>When Google introduced the <a href="http://www.google.com/phone" target="_blank">Nexus One</a> smartphone early this year, we got a glimpse into what the future could be if device makers a) wrested control of the device from the mobile carriers and b) trusted users to decide what software they could run on the hardware they&#8217;d purchased. The heart of this notion was Google&#8217;s Android operating system running on a device that wasn&#8217;t subject to a mobile carrier&#8217;s deliberate limitations on how it could be used.</p>
<p>The experiment wasn&#8217;t a rousing success for several reasons, not least Google&#8217;s <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/186399/google_faces_deluge_of_nexus_one_complaints.html" target="_blank">ineptness</a> at running a store where it had to, gasp, deal with actual human customers needing technical support. Still, the Nexus One was the class of the not-Apple world, in my view, which is why I bought one and still use it with almost entirely happy results.</p>
<p>But Google has withdrawn from selling its own devices except to developers. And in the process, as ZDNet&#8217;s Jason Hiner <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/btl/the-dirty-little-secret-about-google-android/38260" target="_blank">persuasively explains</a>, it&#8217;s ceded back to the carriers selling Android phones the control that users had expected for themselves with an open-source operating system.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Google has made ominous common cause with Verizon in the policy arena, saying that it&#8217;s OK to toss out network neutrality &#8212; the idea that carriers shouldn&#8217;t discriminate on the basis of content &#8212; on mobile networks. Add it all up, and Google&#8217;s retreat is distressing.</p>
<p>The emboldened carriers have started <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2010/07/bloatware-android-phones/" target="_blank">loading all kinds of &#8220;crapware&#8221;</a> &#8212; apps from partner companies that can&#8217;t be removed in standard configurations and that can slow down the devices. (For that matter, Google itself has done this with the Nexus One and Android, by putting unremovable apps into the operating system updates.)</p>
<p>Now, you can get an iPhone without this stuff. Unfortunately, you also get AT&amp;T&#8217;s lackluster network and, much worse, Apple&#8217;s control freakery. Apple decides through its app-approval process what you&#8217;re allowed to use on the device, where Android phones (in almost all cases) don&#8217;t block you from installing what you want in addition to what they&#8217;ve already placed on the phones.</p>
<p>I wish Google &#8212; or more likely HTC or some other manufacturer willing to risk annoying the carriers &#8212; would sell an Android handset that I could use any way I want: an unlocked, un-crapwared device with lots of power and room to expand. Unfortunately there&#8217;s no sign of such a phone on the horizon, though I&#8217;ll keep watching.</p>
<p>The alternative is less attractive. It&#8217;s the rough equivalent of what the iPhone community calls &#8220;<a href="http://iphone-dev.org/" target="_blank">jailbreaking</a>&#8221; &#8212; removing the artificial limitations in the operating system by fixing the software.</p>
<p>In the Android world this is typically called &#8220;rooting&#8221; the phone (again, not exactly the same thing as jailbreaking an iPhone), or giving the customer what&#8217;s also called &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superuser" target="_blank">Superuser</a>&#8221; access to all functions. There are risks in doing this, notably in security, but increasingly I&#8217;m inclined to believe they&#8217;re <a href="http://thenextweb.com/mobile/2010/05/07/5-reasons-root-android/" target="_blank">worth it</a>.</p>
<p>So as I look for a new Android phone, which I&#8217;m doing as the hardware gets better and better, I&#8217;m watching several online forums for information, especially the <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/index.php" target="_blank">XDA Developers</a> site. Notably, I want to know<em>before</em> I buy that I can root the phone and, in some cases, update to the latest Android operating system with full features.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this process isn&#8217;t always easy or simple, which is just fine, I&#8217;m sure, with the mobile network companies. But until we move into a mobile world where at least one carrier and manufacturer allow their customers to actually own what they&#8217;ve purchased, we&#8217;ll be forced to overcome these barriers.</p>

		<p><em>This article was </em><a href="http://www.salon.com/technology/dan_gillmor/2010/08/19/facebook_and_location/index.html" target="_blank"><em>originally published</em></a><em> on Salon on August 19, 2010.</em></p>
<h3>Social networking giant moves swiftly to be the central reality in your digital life</h3>
<p>One of the obvious missing pieces in the Facebook data arsenal has been granular location data &#8212; knowing where its users are and what they&#8217;re doing. The modest but genuine inroads we&#8217;ve seen from startups such as<a href="http://foursquare.com/" target="_blank">Foursquare</a> and <a href="http://gowalla.com/" target="_blank">Gowalla</a>, among others, proved that at least some members of the latest generation of Internet users are willing to share their location, among many other things, with friends, colleagues and maybe everyone else.</p>
<p>So last evening&#8217;s <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13577_3-20013223-36.html?tag=mncol;txt" target="_blank">rumor</a>-confirming rollout of <a href="http://www.facebook.com/places/" target="_blank">Facebook Places</a>, a location check-in service that has a lot in common with what&#8217;s come before, wasn&#8217;t a big surprise.  Facebook is nothing if not eager to incorporate other companies&#8217; innovations into its own core services.</p>
<p>The launch demonstrated a number of Facebook&#8217;s qualities. On the positive side, the Places pitch also included the notion that we need to get out from behind our screens, PC and mobile, and join each other in the physical world. Can&#8217;t argue with that, even if <a href="http://meetup.com/" target="_blank">Meetup.com</a> has been years ahead in the hugely important recognition that one of technology&#8217;s greatest values is in bringing people together to collaborate on offline goals.</p>
<p>The company insisted it had made a serious effort to create meaningful and, if desired, somewhat protective user privacy settings, and it does look possible to stay out of the location service if you wish while still using the service&#8217;s other features. Yet the bias &#8212; as always with Facebook settings &#8212; aims to get you to say Yes to sharing, not No.</p>
<p>The breathtaking über-ness of the initiative shone through in what a company vice president, Christopher Cox, described as a goal: essentially to aggregate history itself &#8212; or at least tomorrow&#8217;s version of it &#8212; around users&#8217; locations, doings and what they&#8217;ve told each other about both.</p>
<p>And Facebook will be holding it all in its corporate databases, creating a data set that advertisers will surely find irresistable. (In my case, no thanks &#8212; but this is a topic for another day.)</p>
<p>Facebook&#8217;s not alone in having vast ambitions, of course. Google, for example, has major social-networking plans of its own and no small amount of location expertise. So presuming Facebook doesn&#8217;t succeed in its goal to <em>become</em> the Internet that most people use &#8212; Internet users will need to figure out that Facebook isn&#8217;t really their friend &#8212; a healthy competitive marketplace could still emerge. Will it include the innovators who have helped bring location so prominently into the mix?</p>
<p>When Foursquare and Gowalla shared the stage with Facebook executives, you had to wonder what they were thinking. Certainly they seemed to celebrate their new partnership. Maybe it&#8217;ll all work out, but technology history suggests other possibilities.</p>
<p>When Microsoft was the despotic ruler of the personal computing software world in the 1990s, it had a strategy some called &#8220;embrace and extend&#8221; &#8212; to develop software that had the functions someone else had already created and then to extend it in ways that would tend to freeze out others. In time, that phrase morphed, according to Microsoft&#8217;s rivals, to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embrace,_extend_and_extinguish#" target="_blank">&#8220;embrace, extend, extinguish.&#8221;</a></p>
<p>Maybe the earlier location services have the kind of deal with Facebook that will give them what they need to grow. If I were one of their investors, I would not be betting on this outcome.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d be betting more on an updated riddle (which I first heard in the 1990s in relation to dealings between Apple and IBM):</p>
<p>Q: What do you get when you combine Facebook and Foursquare? A: Facebook.</p>

<h3>District loaned laptops to students, then used spyware to take pictures of them. Prosecutors: No &#8220;criminal intent&#8221;</h3>
<p>Federal prosecutors are showing uncommon sympathy for some Pennsylvania school officials who spied on students via webcams in their school-owned laptop computers: They&#8217;ve <a href="http://www.philly.com/inquirer/local/20100818_No_charges_in_Lower_Merion_webcam_case.html" target="_blank">decided not to prosecute</a>.</p>
<p>The reason? &#8220;For the government to prosecute a criminal case, it must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the person charged acted with criminal intent,&#8221; the U.S. Attorney&#8217;s office <a href="http://philadelphia.fbi.gov/dojpressrel/pressrel10/ph081710.htm" target="_blank">said in a statement</a>. &#8220;We have not found evidence that would establish beyond a reasonable doubt that anyone involved had criminal intent.&#8221;</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s leave aside the fact that people are charged all the time for criminal offenses despite having no idea they&#8217;re committing crimes. And since when did ignorance of the law confer immunity?</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s focus instead on the fundamental creepiness in what happened at the Lower Merion School District in suburban Philadelphia. A lot of the facts and fuller context in this privacy debacle remain murky. Let&#8217;s hope that the discovery process in the several civil suits results in a more complete disclosure, but we do know this:</p>
<p>The district loaned laptop computers to students and then, under a program the district said was aimed at recovering lost or stolen machines, used spyware to capture tens of thousands of images of kids. Some of those images, it emerged in <a href="http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/04/webcamscanda/" target="_blank">civil suits filed</a> against the officials, were taken in students&#8217; homes &#8212; and some of those in their bedrooms. Oh, just a terrible mistake, said the district.</p>
<p>Some 38,000 images from six computers alone, not to mention <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20100817/ap_on_hi_te/us_laptops_spying_on_students" target="_blank">video chats and IMs in at least one case</a>? If this is an oversight, a mere mistake, yike. But if so, the people who were that sloppy shouldn&#8217;t be trusted to teach elementary arithmetic or anything else.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s apparently no state law against this kind of thing. That&#8217;s outrageous by itself. And while the feds have concluded that they can&#8217;t pursue criminal charges, no one should even consider letting the school district off the hook in any moral way for its reprehensible behavior.</p>
<p>The case also reminds us that civil lawsuits play a vital role in our society. Yes, some plaintiffs&#8217; lawyers launch meritless lawsuits and cause wide harm. But sometimes, as in this case, they are the last line of defense when powerful institutions beat up on individuals. We forget that at our peril.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>This article was <a href="http://www.salon.com/technology/dan_gillmor/2010/08/16/hewlett_packard_follies/index.html" target="_blank">originally published</a> on Salon on August 16, 2010.</p>
<h3>HP has a lot more questions to answer about CEO Mark Hurd&#8217;s mysterious departure</h3>
<p>I have no idea whether the Wall Street Journal&#8217;s <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703382304575431792690877302.html" target="_blank">lurid story</a> today about Mark Hurd&#8217;s forced departure from Hewlett Packard is believable. It&#8217;s impossible to judge because the paper relies so thoroughly on unnamed sources who are said to be, in the latest journo-lingo that purports to explain a grant of anonymity, &#8220;familiar with the situation.&#8221;</p>
<p>But what we do know is this: HP hasn&#8217;t come close to making sense about Hurd&#8217;s resignation, which was demanded by the board several weeks ago. There&#8217;s clearly a scandal, but what is it, exactly?</p>
<p>When a journalist as smart as the New York Times&#8217; Joe Nocera is reduced to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/14/business/14nocera.html" target="_blank">sheer speculation</a> &#8212; he believes the board canned Hurd essentially because they and the employees had come to despise the guy &#8212; you know that the situation has spun wildly out of bounds.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t buy Nocera&#8217;s take for one main reason. The board totally enabled Hurd to become one of the greedier and nastier CEOs of recent times. He is clearly a talented man, but his record at HP wasn&#8217;t entirely the triumph that his acolytes in the business press trumpted. His tenure featured<a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/chris-obrien/ci_15205836" target="_blank">mega-slashing</a> of people, and <a href="http://www.thestreet.com/story/10830261/hurds-excesses-have-been-in-plain-sight.html" target="_blank">mega-enriching</a> of himself and his insider cronies.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m as lost as everyone else when it comes to understanding precisely what, if anything, transpired between Hurd and Jodie Fisher. She&#8217;s the actor who was, apparently, being paid $5,000 a pop to be a hostess at HP events.</p>
<p>I say &#8220;apparently&#8221; because, like everyone else except the insiders who do know, I&#8217;m not sure what happened. HP&#8217;s stonewalling on just about everything has been epic, and in particular the company hasn&#8217;t come close to clean about the precise nature of their relationship.</p>
<p>One question that has a plain answer is this one: What happened to the HP of Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, the men who built a company that held human beings &#8212; and their humanity and communities &#8212; as <a href="http://www.hpalumni.org/hp_way.htm" target="_blank">essential to the mission</a> as anything the people created?</p>
<p>What happened was this: It was destroyed by market and political conditions that encouraged boards and CEOs to exemplify the worst of American capitalism.</p>
<p>HP&#8217;s board has dug itself a deep hole, and it keeps digging. I take some comfort in knowing that <a href="http://blog.pmarca.com/" target="_blank">Marc Andreessen</a> is becoming a more visible board member, because I have trouble believing he&#8217;s comfortable with what&#8217;s going on at HP. I have absolutely no inside knowledge, but I find myself hoping he&#8217;s leading a board uprising. Someone needs to do it. Quickly.</p>
