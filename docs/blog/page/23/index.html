America is getting ready to sharply escalate the war in Afghanistan. The health care system careens toward collapse, with legislation pending that may well make problems worse. The global economy may be in much worse shape than most people had imagined.</p>
<p>Yet what&#8217;s the Story of the Day? It&#8217;s the minor car accident of a celebrity golfer who &#8212; this makes &#8220;journalists&#8221; really angry &#8212; chooses to exercise his constitutional rights by not talking with the police until he&#8217;s good and ready, if ever.</p>
<p>Journalists bemoan the fact that the public doesn&#8217;t take them seriously anymore. Then they turn around and show why.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Michael Gerson, former chief speechwriter for George W. Bush and now one of the Washington Post&#8217;s assemblage of conservative columnists, bemoans today what his headline writer calls &#8220;<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/11/25/AR2009112503534.html?hpid=opinionsbox1">journalism&#8217;s slow, sad death</a>.&#8221; It&#8217;s yet another paean to the demise of monopoly/oligopoly media that, at its best, did perform occasional acts of public service. (Like so many pieces of its ilk, the column complains, among other things, that all those bloggers and other Internet news sites are living off the work of actual reporters; but the column contains no actual reporting other than a visit to a <a href="http://www.newseum.org/">museum</a> of journalism.) He writes:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Professional journalism is not like the buggy-whip industry, outdated by economic progress, to be mourned but not missed. This profession has a social value that is currently not reflected in its market value.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t economic progress, but technological progress, that did in the buggy-whip industry. Did anyone ever mourn it, much less miss it, other than the people it employed and the communities where they lived?</p>
<p>Journalism&#8217;s social value is real. But the social value of the journalism <em>business</em>? Of the professional class of journalists that rose to claim white-collar, insider status and abused it so royally?</p>
<p>I suspect that what Gerson really misses is the subservient lapdog the Washington press corps, with a few honorable <a href="http://www.mcclatchydc.com/">institutional exceptions</a>, became during the early part of this decade.  And what, for example, is the social value of his own newspaper&#8217;s continuing refusal to acknowledge, much less correct, <a href="http://mediactive.com/2009/10/24/washington-post-editorial-remains-uncorrected/">an egregious error</a> on the editorial page that employs him?</p>
<p>My disgust with American newspapers grows with every such woe-is-us piece. They complain and complain about what we&#8217;re losing, and howl at the moon over the flaws of what&#8217;s emerging, even as they so often fail at remotely living up to their own proclaimed standards.</p>
<p>In my last posting, &#8220;<a href="http://mediactive.com/2009/11/24/that-hallowed-standard-of-accuracy-oops/">That Hallowed Standard of Accuracy: Oops</a>&#8220;, I deconstructed, at perhaps tedious length, a column by a Tennessee editorial page editor, Tom Bohs, who got so many things wrong in a piece that briefly discussed me and my work. The errors included misspelling my name and the name of a university with which I was once affiliated, and those were emblematic of the pure sloppiness and incoherence of the overall piece.</p>
<p>My name and the university&#8217;s have been corrected in the online column. But there is not even a hint that anything was wrong before &#8212; a correction method that holds ethical transparency in contempt &#8211;and none of the other points was addressed.</p>
<p>What kind of standards do these news organizations have? They don&#8217;t seem close to the allegedly professional ones Bohs and Gerson claim for their craft&#8217;s traditional members.</p>
<p>For years I&#8217;ve argued that we need to keep the good things that newspapers and the (vanishingly few) good broadcast journalism outlets do in the course of their work. We do need good journalism, but it&#8217;s increasingly clear that we&#8217;ll have a lot of it from the new entrants in the digital media ecosystem.</p>
<p>As for the old guard, I&#8217;ve just about given up caring. Their organizations are committing slow-motion suicide. Maybe the people left in the business, apart from the few serious innovators, lack the imaginations and/or talent, or are so overworked by corporate bosses that they can&#8217;t even try. But I&#8217;m not sure anymore what we&#8217;d really lose if their organizations all died tomorrow.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>(UPDATE: <em>Since I posted this on Nov. 24, the two misspellings in the newspaper column discussed below have been corrected, without a hint (in the online version, anyway) that there was ever a mistake in the first place. The other inaccuracies and questionable information remain in place.)<br />
</em><br />
My heart goes out, at least a little, to Tom Bohs, editorial page editor of the <a href="http://www.jacksonsun.com/">Jackson Sun</a> in Tennessee. He is undoubtedly wishing he&#8217;d spent a little more time on a column he published this week.</p>
<p>His piece, entitled &#8220;<a href="http://www.jacksonsun.com/article/20091122/COLUMNISTS01/911220301">Citizen journalist, pick your beat.&#8221;</a> featured some standard, boilerplate stereotypes &#8212; such as people with mobile-phone cameras who contribute what they shoot to &#8220;real&#8221; media organizations like, uh, the Sun &#8212; with just the barest effort to acknowledge the enormous variety and in some cases quality of non-traditional offerings that are diversifying the media ecosystem. Overall, the column comes off as yet another semi-informed member of the old guard wishing he could turn back the clock. No big deal.</p>
<p>So why am I feeling some sympathy for Bohs? It&#8217;s because of his column&#8217;s final four paragraphs, which may well have earned him a spot in the Irony Hall of Fame, or at least the Media Criticism wing.</p>
<p>Bohs wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>To give you a little perspective, however, the guy who folks say invented modern citizen journalism is former San Jose Mercury News journalist Dan Gilmour. He was a technology columnist for the newspaper which operates deep in the heart of Silicon Valley. He allegedly wrote the first newspaper online blog. Then he wrote a book about citizen journalism titled &#8216;We the Media.&#8217; Then he got out of the news business. </em></p>
<p><em>I&#8217;m not sure what that means. Today, Gilmour runs an operation called the Center for Citizen Media at UC Berkely. I guess he figured with all these citizens running around doing his job, he needed to find a new line of work, teaching them to do his former job &#8211; for free. </em></p>
<p><em>As the news business continues to evolve at the mercy of technology, citizen journalism is going to play a major role. Here is a simple guideline to help you evaluate what you read on the blogs and forums, chats and tweets. It is a guideline old school journalists still live by: If your mother tells you she loves you, check it out. </em></p>
<p><em>I hope our new era of citizen journalists adopt the standard, as well.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Oh, my, where to begin&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li>I don&#8217;t know which folks say I invented modern citizen journalism. I&#8217;m not one of them. I&#8217;ve definitely been among the many people who&#8217;ve worked to help it happen, and to make it as good as possible for everyone involved.</li>
<li>My last name is spelled Gillmor, not Gilmour.</li>
<li>I &#8220;allegedly wrote the first newspaper online blog&#8221;? (Copy editors: All blogs are online.) Not sure what the &#8220;allegedly&#8221; is all about, except possibly to suggest some faint unseemliness or false claim. Who&#8217;s alleged to have said it, anyway? Mine may well have been the first blog by a daily newspaper journalist, but that&#8217;s all I&#8217;ll claim.</li>
<li>Aha, a true fact: I did write <em>We the Media</em>.</li>
<li>No, I didn&#8217;t then get out of the news business. I started what turned out to be an ill-fated Bay Area news site, Bayosphere, which was definitely part of the news business. I started the Center for Citizen Media (see below for current status), one of the purposes of which was to help extend the news business. I&#8217;ve invested in and/or advised a number of enterprises &#8212; some for-profit and some not-for-profit &#8212; that have been deeply involved in the news and information sphere. I&#8217;ve been a paid speaker or consultant for several newspaper companies, and wrote occasional columns for the Financial Times (which I trust Bohs will concede is part of the real News Business) and still contribute periodically to other publications. My current position at Arizona State University is all about the news business: working with students studying journalism, business and other disciplines to help them create what we hope will be some of tomorrow&#8217;s lasting local-information enterprises. I&#8217;m more in the news business than I ever was as a columnist for a California newspaper.</li>
<li>The Center for Citizen Media still exists, but is mostly dormant at this point. It was affiliated with the University of California, Berkeley (that&#8217;s Berkeley with an &#8220;e&#8221; between the &#8220;l&#8221; and &#8220;y&#8221;), as well as Harvard University&#8217;s Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society, and is now affiliated with Arizona State. I haven&#8217;t been affiliated in any way with UC Berkeley for almost two years at this point, though I&#8217;m still fond of my former colleagues and students.</li>
<li>At no point in my work on citizen journalism have I pitched it as a replacement for traditional journalism. From the beginning I&#8217;ve said it would be a great addition, in its myriad forms, to the ecosystem, and competitive only in some spaces. I&#8217;ve also said, again and again in talks and in public writing, that while I hoped citizens would help traditional news organizations by participating in community journalism, I was and remain flatly opposed to business models that assume citizens are offering nothing but free labor for others to monetize.</li>
<li>Who&#8217;s running around doing my old job as a business and technology journalist? Lots of people, including traditional journalists and online-only creative types whose work has greatly increased the amount and in many cases the quality of tech information. Some bloggers are doing it for little or no money, for lots of reasons &#8212; they may be in the business; they may be building their brands; they may just love to cover a small niche &#8212; while other online journalists are making serious money at it, building important and well-funded new media organizations. The very last thing I figured when I co-taught a course at Berkeley was that I needed the job because citizen journalists had priced me out of the market. (When Bohs says &#8220;I guess&#8221;, that&#8217;s a point I won&#8217;t argue.)</li>
<li>The news business is clearly being affected by technology. It is not at the mercy of technology. Journalists will continue to do journalism, using the evolving tools of the trade in enterprises that adapt to change, long after newspapers have faded from the scene. The only news people at the utter mercy of technology are the ones who have given up on themselves.</li>
</ul>
<p>And now we come to Bohs&#8217; stern advice &#8212; preceded, to be fair, by an acknowledgment that citizen journalism is here to stay &#8212; to all those who need to decide what to make of what they find online. Follow the lead of the pros, he says: Don&#8217;t trust it unless you&#8217;ve checked it out.</p>
<p>Bohs could have checked out everything he said about me and got so absurdly wrong, even without picking up the phone and calling. He could have used that new-fangled Google thing, where typing in &#8220;Dan Gillmor&#8221; &#8212; or even &#8220;Dan Gilmour&#8221; &#8212; returns links to <a href="http://dangillmor.com">dangillmor.com</a> (the top one with the correct spelling, third on the list for the one Bohs used), where I lay out in some detail exactly what I&#8217;ve been doing for the past few years and am doing now, with links to the blogs where I&#8217;ve been saying what I actually believe about journalism and its future, not what other people may claim (or imagine) I&#8217;ve said. Even my Wikipedia entry, which has some small inaccuracies, has my current gig listed correctly.</p>
<p>This is why Bohs, who clearly cares about journalism, surely must have had a sinking feeling in his gut last night or this morning when he discovered his mistakes. I hope he&#8217;ll turn that into a renewed dedication to the principles in which he says he believes.</p>

		<p><a href="http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/heroes-cooper.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1007  alignleft" style="margin-left: 4px; margin-right: 4px;" title="heroes-cooper.jpg" src="http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/heroes-cooper-228x300.jpg" alt="Anderson Cooper CNN" width="228" height="300" srcset="http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/heroes-cooper-228x300.jpg 228w, http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/heroes-cooper.jpg 312w" sizes="(max-width: 228px) 100vw, 228px" /></a>The photo at left is from the back cover of Sunday&#8217;s New York Times Magazine. It exemplifies much of what can be right with American journalism, and some of what&#8217;s wrong, too.</p>
<p>The part to celebrate, of course, is CNN&#8217;s decision to highlight some eminently praise-worthy people. Yes, there&#8217;s an element of cliche about it &#8212; running the show in Thanksgiving &#8212; but so what? If we can&#8217;t give thanks for (some of) the people who deserve it on our best holiday, when can we?</p>
<p>The best part of the program, at least from the <a href="http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/cnn.heroes/archive09/index.html">promos and articles</a> about the people being honored,  is that they&#8217;re &#8220;regular folks&#8221; doing out-of-the-ordinary things. (Military personnel seem to be ineligible for these awards, which is an odd omission, but the honorees are certainly impressive in their own right.) You can find instructions on the website on how to donate your own time and/or money to various causes championed by the honorees. All in all, CNN is doing something good for the world with this event.</p>
<p>But look again at this image. Who&#8217;s that towering over the honorees? Why, it&#8217;s Anderson Cooper, the host of the program. Apparently he and his network are the real heros.</p>
<p>Look, I know this is about promoting an event. And I  know that Cooper is the face people will recognize.</p>
<p>But the way this is framed tells the story of network &#8220;journalism&#8221; today &#8212; a celebrity-infused system that conflates news readers with the people they cover.</p>
<p>Anderson Cooper may well be a fine journalist. I can&#8217;t really say, as I&#8217;ve given up on CNN and the other U.S. &#8220;news&#8221; networks for anything but stenography for the rich and powerful, fluff and, occasionally, breaking news where the events tell their own stories.</p>
<p>If Cooper is a indeed good journalist, or even a respectable one, this image should make him cringe. And someday, sooner than later, he should say so out loud.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>a new pro bono initiative that connects lawyers and law school clinics from across the country with online journalists and digital media creators who need legal help. Lawyers participating in OMLN will provide qualifying online publishers with pro bono and reduced fee legal assistance on a broad range of legal issues, including business formation and governance, copyright licensing and fair use, employment and freelancer agreements, access to government information, pre-publication review of content, and representation in litigation.</p></blockquote>
<p></em><br />
This is a valuable initiative. It will help many more people than the individuals who receive assistance from volunteer lawyers and law students in specific cases.</p>
<p>One of the common misconceptions in digital media over the past few years has been the notion that bloggers may be somehow exempt from the laws that apply to other forms of publishing. Nothing could be further from the truth.</p>
<p>The laws aren&#8217;t only about defamation, though that&#8217;s where the biggest threats to independent journalists can be found &#8212; in part because the independents don&#8217;t have legal teams at their disposal. Some plaintiffs have sued or threatened to sue largely to shut down criticism, not because they&#8217;ve actually been defamed, and just the threat of a lawsuit is often enough to shut down legitimate speech.</p>
<p>There are lots of other legal issues you need to think about if you publish on the Web, including fair use, freelance agreements, setting up businesses and the like. The new network will help with those issues, too, among others.</p>
<p>The CMLP has lined up an impressive <a href="http://www.omln.org/lawyers">collection of lawyers and law clinics</a> for this initiative. They all deserve thanks as well.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><img src="http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/pierre-omidyar.png" alt="pierre omidyar.png" border="0" width="271" height="245" align="left" hspace=5 vspace=2 /><a href="http://www.omidyar.com/team/pierre-omidyar">Pierre Omidyar</a>, founder of eBay, is launching a for-profit news startup in Hawaii, where he and his family live. This is important news, and not just because he&#8217;s involved.</p>
<p>A few months ago Pierre and Randy Ching founded <a href="http://peernews.com">Peer News</a>. Their first project was a Twitter-related experiment called <a href="http://www.ginx.com">Ginx</a>, which didn&#8217;t get critical mass and is being closed.</p>
<p>Now they&#8217;ve announced Peer News&#8217; more important move &#8212; a project aimed at creating the kind of local journalism that brings accountability and value to a community. </p>
<p>Pierre, in a note on the <a href="http://blog.peernews.com/interest-lead/http://blog.peernews.com/2009/11/18/aloha/">company blog</a>, says he and his team are launching &#8212; they aim for early 2010 &#8212; based on deep research: &#8220;talking to a lot of people in the industry about journalism and how we might be able to have an impact, listening and learning as much as we can.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m one of the people Pierre has talked with, but I&#8217;m not privy to the details of the new venture. In a conversation last evening, he did say this will be service combining professional journalists and citizen journalists in &#8220;a commercial model that hasn&#8217;t been tried yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tantalizing, no? Let&#8217;s focus for a second on the word &#8220;commercial,&#8221; because Pierre and team are going for something that seems to have fallen somewhat out of favor for local news startups, the notion that they can and should be profitable. Not-for-profits are springing up in various places, and while Pierre is happy to see them he also believes it&#8217;s essential to find solid for-profit models for sustainable media.</p>
<p>One message is for the local newspapers: Watch out. Pierre has analyzed the Hawaii media market and sees enough advertising money is going toward journalism in Honolulu &#8220;to fund a high quality operation&#8221; &#8212; but clearly not the kind that dominates the revenue stream today, namely the local newspapers.</p>
<p>Peer News will operate in the leanest possible way compatible with doing solid journalism and community information. It will involve social media in a big way as well. (The <a href="http://omidyar.net">Omidyar Network</a>, the investing and charitable arm of Pierre and his wife, Pam, has been deep into socially valuable media for a long time. Count on them bringing what they&#8217;ve learned into Peer News.)</p>
<p>Plainly, the Hawaii launch is a test bed, in part. If it works, expect more local versions in other places. </p>
<p>Peer News is looking for a founding editor. My advice has been to find someone local, if at all possible, but especially to find someone excellent. If you&#8217;re interested, <a href="http://blog.peernews.com/interest-lead/">here&#8217;s where</a> you can find out more.</p>
<p>One of the people who&#8217;ll be talking to editorial candidates is Howard Weaver, a former vice president of news at McClatchy. Howard has been consulting with Peer News and offers some perspective on his <a href="http://editor.blogspot.com/2009/11/looking-toward-one-future-for-local.html">own blog</a>, including this:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I’m interested for a lot of reasons, but I’d sum it up this way: the new venture intends to demonstrate that a digitally native, technologically fluent web organization can profitably serve targeted readers who want sophisticated journalism focused on local civic affairs.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Maybe Pierre and his team have cracked part of the code for sustainable digital journalism. Maybe not. But the fact that they&#8217;re going to try, with some serious resources behind the effort, is great news.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;m looking forward to following the progress of Peer News. So should anyone who&#8217;s interested in the future of journalism. </p>
<p><em>(Note: The Omidyar Network was a seed funder of my long-ago Grassroots Media (Bayosphere) project. It lost money.)</em></p>

<blockquote><p><em>embed the upload functionality of YouTube directly into your own site, enabling your organization to request, review, and re-broadcast user-submitted videos with ease. News organizations can ask for citizen reporting; nonprofits can call-out for support videos around social campaigns; businesses can ask users to submit promotional videos about your brand.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Essentially this lets anyone create the equivalent of CNN&#8217;s <a href="http://www.ireport.com/">iReport</a> operation. It&#8217;s a smart move by YouTube, and a welcome one in many respects. </p>
<p>But it&#8217;s the equivalent of iReport in another way that&#8217;s just as unfortunate as the original: no compensation for the video creators apart from a pat on the back.</p>
<p>In fact, it&#8217;s worse than that. Look at the <a href="http://www1.whdh.com/termsofuse">terms of service</a> at Channel 7 in Boston, one of YouTube&#8217;s partners, which include the following:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>(W)hen you submit or post any material, you are granting us, and anyone authorized by us, a royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, unrestricted, worldwide license to use, copy, modify, transmit, sell, exploit, create derivative works from, distribute and/or publicly perform or display such material, in whole or in part, in any manner or medium, now known or hereafter developed, for any purpose. The foregoing grant shall include the right to exploit any proprietary rights in such posting or submission, including, but not limited to, rights under copyright, trademark, service mark, patent or other intellectual property law under any relevant jurisdiction.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>As far as I can tell, none of the partners has even suggested an intention to pay anyone for what they submit. Which makes the tool a giveaway for the creator &#8212; and a windfall for the collector, not to mention YouTube, which cements its position in online video.</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s a silver lining. YouTube has open-sourced the platform. This means someone could add a feature the system desperately needs. I wrote about it a few months ago in <a href="http://mediactive.com/2009/07/29/needed-real-time-media-auction-system/">this post</a>. </p>
<p>To repeat what I said then, we need better ways: </p>
<blockquote><p><em>to reward creators when it comes to breaking news, where news organizations derive enormous benefits from having the right image or video at the right time and too frequently get it for less than peanuts. Indeed, practically every news organization now invites its audience to submit pictures and videos, in return for which the submitters typically get zip.</p>
<p>Which is why we need a more robust marketplace than any I’ve seen so far, namely a real-time auction system.</p>
<p>The sites currently promoting citizen journalists’ work don’t offer anything of this sort, as far as I can tell. This isn’t to say I don’t like those sites, which include NowPublic and Demotix, because I like them a great deal. But someone needs to go further.</p>
<p>How would a real-time auction system work? The flow, I’d imagine, would go like this:</p>
<p>Photographer captures breaking news event on video or audio, and posts the work to the auction site. Potential buyers, especially media companies, get to see watermarked thumbnails and then start bidding. A time limit is enforced in each case. The winning bid goes to the journalist, minus a cut to the auction service.</p>
<p>The premium, then, would be on timeliness and authenticity. One or two images/videos would be likely to command relatively high prices, and everything else would be worth considerably less.</p>
<p>Eventually, someone will do this kind of business — which could also be useful for eyewitness text accounts of events. For the sake of the citizen journalists who are not getting what they deserve for their work, I hope it’s sooner than later.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>This is worth working on, and fast, before the news industry decides it has found a nifty way to make money on other people&#8217;s work.</p>

But it is well-meaning, and was written in a time when it was possible to control what media did within a political jurisdiction, at least for widespread public attention, not in a time when anyone can publish for a global audience.</p>
<p>The networked-world element of the case is a reminder of an ongoing problem in the Digital Age. It&#8217;s bad enough that the Germans have such a law, but it&#8217;s their country. What&#8217;s clearly over the top is trying to pull this information from the English version. The Wikimedia Foundation has rightly refused. (This reminds me to make a <a href="http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Support_Wikipedia2">donation to the project</a>.)</p>
<p>I worry that the German lawyers &#8212; and authorities &#8212; will escalate. Even though Wikimedia has no assets in Germany, I&#8217;d be unsurprised if the case finds its way into American courts, for no other purpose than forcing the foundation to spend money defending itself. That&#8217;s a punishment in its own right.</p>
<p>And suppose the German lawyers persuade courts there to order the arrest of Wikimedia Foundation employees should they visit the country. This isn&#8217;t probable, no doubt, but if I were on the board I&#8217;d keep a close eye on the risks of stopping in Germany even to change planes.</p>
<p>The broader lessons are part of the changing nature of communications &#8212; and of changing norms. The Electronic Frontier Foundation&#8217;s Jennifer Grannick addresses the former, in context of this case, in <a href="http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2009/11/murderer-wikipedia-shhh">this way</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>At stake is the integrity of history itself. If all publications have to abide by the censorship laws of any and every jurisdiction just because they are accessible over the global internet, then we will not be able to believe what we read, whether about Falun Gong (censored by China), the Thai king (censored under</em> lèse majesté<em>) or German murders.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>We&#8217;ll be fighting these fights for decades to come. People who would control what others can read (listen to, view, etc.) &#8212; in order to control what they think and, ultimately, do &#8212; will not stop trying to have such powers. (Reminder to self: Send <a href="https://secure.eff.org/site/Donation2?df_id=1480&amp;1480.donation=form1&amp;s_src=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.eff.org%2Fdeeplinks%2F2009%2F11%2Fmurderer-wikipedia-shhh&amp;s_subsrc=default">EFF a donation</a>, too.)</p>
<p>But the deeper, harder issue is changing norms, because we have to ask ourselves if we truly want permanent records of everything we&#8217;ve ever done &#8212; and if there&#8217;s no choice in that matter whether we want people only to know us for the worst of our actions, not the sum of ourselves.</p>
<p>The German murders, Werlé and Lauber, don&#8217;t get much sympathy in this regard. Nor should they: Murder strikes me as the central act of these men&#8217;s lives, though we should also note that they have paid the debt to their society that entitles them to re-enter that society with some respect from others, difficult as that may be. Do they really expect, however, that even a ban on publishing their names will expunge their deeds from people&#8217;s knowledge? Yet the motive behind the German law is a sound one: to help those who&#8217;ve transgressed restore their membership in society.</p>
<p>As the Wall Street Journal reported this week, job seekers are trying to get minor criminal offenses <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB125789494126242343.html">fully expunged</a> from court records and online databases, especially ones where plea agreements promised such nullifying of the record. We are apparently so unforgiving as a society that even an arrest at some point in your life can be a job disqualification, even if you were totally innocent or if the charge was absurdly petty.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the problem. Databases will keep this stuff around, and on a Web where duplication is the nature of the system, there will ultimately be no way to fully get rid of anything &#8212; or at least we won&#8217;t be able to rely on its disappearance, whether through the obscurity of printed records in dusty courthouse basements or actual destruction of records as promised.</p>
<p>Which comes back to changing norms. Until we start weighing old acts against the totality of someone&#8217;s experiences and deeds, we&#8217;ll hold a sword over each others&#8217; head. Is this really the way we want to live?</p>
