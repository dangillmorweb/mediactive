		<p>You may have noticed some site problems &#8212; so have we, and they appear to relate to the WordPress theme we&#8217;ve been using. We&#8217;ve disabled it for the time being until we figure out WTF has been happening to make the site slow to a crawl, so badly that it was affecting other sites on the server.</p>
<p>UPDATE: Looks like some of the old theme remains in the cache, which is preventing some comments from becoming visible. Arghhh&#8230; We&#8217;re working on that, too.</p>
<p>FURTHER UPDATE: Still working on the comments issue. </p>

This is done by replacing the map tiles with one&#8217;s own image tiles. (The post suggests CASA&#8217;s <a href="http://www.casa.ucl.ac.uk/software/googlemapimagecutter.asp">Image Cutter</a> or <a href="http://mapki.com/index.php?title=Automatic_Tile_Cutter">Automatic Tile Cutter</a> for creating tiles).</p>
<p>Google Maps Mania gives a nice nod to the <a href="http://mapwow.com/">gaming community</a> for paving ground here by replacing tilesets with maps of the online worlds in which they spend their time (synthetic community journalism?). Designers are now figuring this out and it&#8217;d be nice to see what journalists can do with it. With newspaper archival in mind this week, an obvious crossover is a microfiche-style conversion of the day&#8217;s paper. However, far more creative uses seem possible.</p>

Consider the following sequence:</p>
<p>On August 7, the New York Times published a Floyd Norris column <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/07/business/07norris1.html?pagewanted=all">criticizing General Electric</a> for financial shenanigans that Norris called Enron-like in some respects. The piece was another bit of the accumulating evidence that the tenure of former CEO Jack Welch had sufficiently sleazy elements to call into question, to put it mildly, Welch&#8217;s super-duper-elite reputation.</p>
<p>GE, like most other big companies, pays legions of people to make bad news go away or at least be less bad. In a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/10/opinion/l10ge.html?_r=1&amp;ref=opinion">letter to the editor</a> published Sept. 9 (the one-month delay is curious), the company&#8217;s &#8220;Executive Director, Communications and Public Affairs&#8221; objected to Norris&#8217; column.</p>

		<p>UPDATED</p>
<p>You may have noticed &#8212; you could hardly miss it &#8212; the current blizzard of one-year anniversary stories about the <a href="http://news.google.com/news/search?pz=1&amp;ned=us&amp;hl=en&amp;q=lehman+brothers&amp;cf=all&amp;as_qdr=w&amp;as_drrb=q">fall of Lehman Brothers</a>, an event that helped spark last fall&#8217;s financial meltdown. The coverage mainly reminds me that journalists failed to do their jobs before last fall&#8217;s crisis emerged, and have continued to fail since then.</p>
<p>It also reminds me of a few pet peeves about the way traditional journalists operate. So here&#8217;s a list of 11 things I&#8217;d insist on, just for starters, if I ran a news organization. Why 11?

He was too cautious by half.</p>
<p>The question was from a student who wanted to be president some day and asked for advice on career paths. According to the White House transcript, he said, in the first of what he called &#8220;practical tips&#8221; for ambitious young people:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I want everybody here to be careful about what you post on Facebook &#8212; because in the YouTube age, whatever you do, it will be pulled up again later somewhere in your life. And when you&#8217;re young, you make mistakes and you do some stupid stuff. And I&#8217;ve been hearing a lot about young people who &#8212; you know, they&#8217;re posting stuff on Facebook, and then suddenly they go apply for a job and somebody has done a search and &#8212; so that&#8217;s some practical political advice for you right there. </em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The president may have been right about this in today&#8217;s world. I hope he&#8217;s wrong in tomorrow&#8217;s. Let&#8217;s unpack what he said to see why.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s absolutely true that young people make mistakes and do stupid things. Anyone who <em>doesn&#8217;t</em> commit youthful stupidities is either inhuman or stunningly boring and inconsequential. Who wants someone like that to be in charge of anything as an adult? Not me.</p>
<p>But it doesn&#8217;t follow, as the president suggested, that posting weird (to older people) things on the Web &#8212; in blogs, social networks and the like &#8212; should be an automatic turnoff or disqualification for a responsible job later on. The notion of punishing someone decades later for what he or she said or did as a teenager or college student just feels wrong to me.</p>
<p>A journalism student where I teach recently asked if it was advisable to have a personal blog or, if so, to be outspoken on it. He&#8217;d apparently been warned that it could put a crimp in his future journalism career plans.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t say how others would react. I do know that if I were hiring someone today I&#8217;d want to know what (not if) he or she posted online, not to find disqualifying factors but to see if this is an interesting person. I&#8217;d take for granted that I might find some things that were risque or inappropriate for my current world. I&#8217;d expect to find things that would be &#8220;unjournalistic&#8221; in some ways, such as outspoken or foolish (or both) views on important people and issues. But I&#8217;d also remember my own ability, if not tendency, to be an idiot when I was that age. And I&#8217;d discount appropriately.</p>
<p>This is all about giving people what my friend Esther Dyson has called a &#8220;statute of limitations on stupidity.&#8221; If we don&#8217;t all start cutting each other more slack in this increasingly transparent (often by our own choice) society, we&#8217;ll only allow drones into positions of authority. Now that&#8217;s really scary.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re making progress, probably more than Obama gives us credit for. Recall that it was impossible for a Catholic to be president, until John F. Kennedy was elected. It was impossible for a divorced person to be elected until Ronald Reagan won. It was impossible for a former pot smoker to be president until Bill Clinton (who bizarrely claimed not to have inhaled) got elected. And so on. </p>
<p>How we make these judgements is neither clear nor simple. Robert McDonnell, a candidate for governor in Virginia, is <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/09/02/AR2009090203444.html?hpid=topnews">taking hits</a> for a 20-year-old master&#8217;s thesis in which he denounced programs that encouraged women to work outside the home and said working women were bad for families. He wants voters to ignore all this and concentrate on what he says are his positions now.</p>
<p>McDonnell deserves some slack, too, but he wrote the thesis when he was in his mid-30s, not his early 20s or younger. His record as a legislator since then has been extremely conservative, as well. What he said two decades ago is obviously more relevant, given the circumstances, than what a student posts on a high-school Facebook page today.</p>
<p>In the foreseeable future, we&#8217;ll elect a president who had blog or Facebook wall or MySpace page when she was a teenager and college student. By the standards of today she&#8217;ll be utterly disqualified for any serious political job. But because we&#8217;ll have grown as a society, not just more tolerant of flaws but understanding that we all have feet of clay in some respect, we&#8217;ll elect her anyway, because we&#8217;ll realize that the person she became &#8212; and how that happened &#8212; is what counts.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p style="clear: both"><a class="image-link" href="http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/president_education_talk-full.png"><img class="linked-to-original" style=" display: inline; float: left; margin: 0 10px 10px 0;" src="http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/president_education_talk-thumb1.png" alt="" width="250" height="174" align="left" /></a>It&#8217;s easy, and appropriate, to feel gloom mixed with contempt at the way some right-wing flamethrowers, abetted by mass media&#8217;s love of conflict, have turned President Obama&#8217;s <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/MediaResources/PreparedSchoolRemarks/">webcast to the nation&#8217;s schoolchildren</a> into a new socialist manifesto. They cherry-picked an innocuous idea from a lesson plan &#8212; the president asking kids to help him do his job better &#8212; and claimed it was radical ideology.</p>
<p style="clear: both">
<p style="clear: both">
<div>So they&#8217;ve persuaded quite a few districts to either not show it or ask parents&#8217; permission. The administrators in those districts have put on a fine demonstration of cowardice. But that is, let&#8217;s be fair, what it takes to run a school system in much of America today, where the worst sin seems to be teaching children how to think for themselves.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the lost opportunity in the Obama talk. Teachers and administrators in the districts that have banned the webcast could have used it in ways that would have put their fear into context. They could have shown it to students and then had a conversation about it.</p></div>
<p style="clear: both">
<p style="clear: both">The Obama critics do have one thing right, though they don&#8217;t seem clear on the concept. They&#8217;re skeptical of what people in authority say. In this case skepticism has morphed into paranoia, as they claim children watching the talk could be indoctrinated by an authority figure who, in their view, is wrong on policy and morality.</p>
<p style="clear: both">Attempting to prevent children from hearing the president&#8217;s words is not just foolish, but counterproductive. I&#8217;m betting this has backfired, given kids&#8217; tendency to seek out what adults tell them to stay away from.</p>
<p style="clear: both">
<p style="clear: both">
<div>Had the fearful administrators chosen to do their jobs, they would have used this speech in at least four ways. They could have shown it and then asked teachers to ask students to to analyze a) what the president had said; b) how he said it; c) how the White House used the media of the day to get his words to the people he wanted to reach; and d) how other media handled the controversy. (They could have done worse than to use the suggested <a href="http://www.ed.gov/teachers/how/lessons/prek-6.pdf">classroom</a> <a href="http://www.ed.gov/teachers/how/lessons/7-12.pdf">activities</a> (PDFs) related to the talk. And I hope that districts where people generally support Obama would also take the opportunity to address these questions.)</div>
<p style="clear: both">
<p style="clear: both">
<div>Buried deep in the Obama address is a single reference to critical thinking, where he refers to &#8220;the insights and critical thinking skills you gain in history and social studies to fight poverty and homelessness, crime and discrimination, and make our nation more fair and more free.&#8221; But are kids really gaining such skills and insights? Not enough, that&#8217;s clear, but sometimes subtlety invades even the most brazen attempts to keep reality away from people.</div>
<p style="clear: both">
<div>The ongoing efforts to to insert religion into science instruction &#8212; essentially insisting that biblical creationism be offered as an &#8220;alternative theory&#8221; to evolution &#8212; are deeply ironic in this context. It&#8217;s one thing to be skeptical, an essential part of critical thinking. It&#8217;s another to turn biology class into Bible study. Yet to the extent that the creationists succeed in this campaign, they are also telling kids to question authority.</div>
<p style="clear: both">
<div>Critical thinking is very much about questioning authority, but not to extremes. It&#8217;s not about disowning the evidence, but rather using it, including information from sources we&#8217;ve come to trust, to make our own decisions. Sometimes we&#8217;ll decide badly. That&#8217;s part of life.</div>
<p style="clear: both">
<div>We&#8217;d decide better if we had better journalism. And this entire mess has featured the too-common substandard variety. Perhaps the people most deserving of contempt in this entire episode are the ones running traditional media organizations that have again abdicated their duty by focusing on the political fighting instead of the serious issues. Even in their coverage of the battles, they&#8217;ve resorted for the most part to the standard stenographic technique of quoting &#8220;both sides&#8221; despite the way one side has been overwhelmingly dishonest.</div>
<p style="clear: both">
<div>David Carr, in his column in yesterday&#8217;s New York Times, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/07/business/media/07carr.html?scp=2&amp;sq=david%20carr&amp;st=cse">took a shot</a> at the problem. He hit the target but missed the bulls-eye. Here&#8217;s an extended quote:</div>
<blockquote style="clear: both"><p><em>The administration seems to believe that if all the information on a given issue is on the table — or in this case, on the Web — then the truth, or at least their version of it, will win out. (The president announced on Friday that with certain exceptions, the names of visitors to the White House would be posted for all to see). For all his modern impulses, President Obama’s press operation seems mired in a high school civics debate version of governance, where points are given for logic and argument.</em></p>
<p><em>That is not how the media works, however, in an environment that prizes engagement and conflict. The long town-hall process over health care, for example, has given ordinary citizens a voice but it has also produced hundreds of video clips of angry, scared Americans. For every aging secretary who can’t afford prescriptions, there is a small business owner who wants less government in their life, not more. Tropes like “death panels” may lack substance, but they make for pretty compelling viewing day after day.</em></p>
<p><em>In part, the outrage and hyperbole work because the mainstream media, insecure about their own status in an atomizing world, play into the tyranny of split-screen coverage where almost any claim — no matter how outlandish — becomes one side in “an interesting debate.” When not listening to talking heads, the traditional news outlets go to great efforts to get a microphone on vox populi. If the people, even if it is some unknown number, are hopping mad, we don’t want to be the last to tell you about it.<br />
</em></p></blockquote>
<p style="clear: both">Bingo. Too bad Carr doesn&#8217;t take his own logic to a logical conclusion. He merely notes &#8220;how the media works&#8221; but doesn&#8217;t even suggest that journalists who cover these issues bear any responsibility for their preference to feed the lie machine instead of counter it. Oh, there have been a few stories pointing out the fundamental unreality on which the protests have been based, but vastly more on the protests themselves.</p>
<p style="clear: both">The most important concept, which Carr misses, is the one the media have abandoned in recent times: responsibility. Look again at the White House graphic at the top of this piece. The president is urging students &#8220;to take responsibility for their educations&#8221; because all the good teaching and parenting won&#8217;t be enough if the students themselves don&#8217;t care.</p>
<p style="clear: both">We share responsibility for knowing what we&#8217;re talking about. The traditional media&#8217;s unwillingness to help &#8212; part of its general collapse &#8212; means that, more and more, it&#8217;s up to the rest of us to figure things out for ourselves.</p>
