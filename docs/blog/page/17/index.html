	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Some members of the traditional publishing industry don&#8217;t care for what I write, and some who do aren&#8217;t thrilled with one of the ways I try to spread my ideas. So when <em>Mediactive </em>appears between dead-tree covers a bit later this year, the traditional publishing industry won&#8217;t be in the mix.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going with <a href="http://lulu.com">Lulu</a>, a company that understands the changes in media. This is a self-publishing service &#8212; an operation that takes my work and turns it into books that can be sold, by me and by anyone else who wants to sell them.</p>
<p>Some background: Last fall, when I started serious work on the book part of this project, I was under contract to the <a href="http://oreilly.com">publisher</a> that brought out <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596102275?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=dangillcom-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0596102275"><em>We the Media</em></a><em><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=dangillcom-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0596102275" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" /></em> a few years ago; we parted company in January. At which point, my literary agent &#8212; the beyond-terrific David Miller of the <a href="http://garamondagency.com">Garamond Agency</a> &#8212; started looking for a new publisher.</p>
<p>My former publisher was fine with Creative Commons, as proved by the fact that we did the first book that way. But as David told me at the outset of the new search, I was likely to limit the potential field because I had one non-negotiable requirement: The book will be published under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a> license. In this case, as with <em>We the Media</em>, the kind of Creative Commons license would say, essentially, that anyone could make copies of the work for non-commercial use, and if they created derivative works, also only for non-commercial purposes, those works would have to be made available a) with credit to me and b) under the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/">same license</a>.</p>
<p>The principle was simple: While I want my writing to get the widest possible distribution, if anyone is going to make money on it I&#8217;d like that to be me, my publisher and my agent.</p>
<p>Almost a decade after Creative Commons was founded, and despite ample evidence that licensing copyrighted works this way doesn&#8217;t harm sales, book publishers remain mostly clueless and/or hostile. As David explained to editors, the main reason <em><strong>I&#8217;m still getting royalty checks</strong></em> for <em>We the Media</em> is that the book has been available as a free download since the day it went into bookstores. Had we not published it that way, given the indifference (at best) shown by American newspapers and magazines, the book would have sunk without a trace.</p>
<p>That logic persuaded no one in New York (not that we got that far in most cases &#8212; more about that below). And to my genuine if not major regret, the Creative Commons roadblock forced me to turn down a deal from a publisher that would have been perfect for this project had I only been writing a book and nothing more.</p>
<p>Two points: First, and most obviously, if a principle means anything, you stick by it when doing so is inconvenient, not just when it&#8217;s easy. Second, this isn&#8217;t just a book, at least not way traditional publishers understand books even as they dabble online.</p>
<p>To publishers, books are items they manufacture and send out in trucks. Or else they&#8217;re computer files to be rented to publishers&#8217; customers, or customers of Amazon, Apple and other companies that use proprietary e-reading software to lock the work down in every possible way. In both cases, publishers crave being the gatekeepers.</p>
<p>Mediactive aims to be a multi-faceted project. Over the next few years, I hope to experiment in lots of media formats and styles with the ideas here. And &#8212; this is key &#8212; I also plan to experiment with it in the broader context of the emerging ecosystem of ideas.</p>
<p>That ecosystem is evolving at an accelerating rate, and the people who have had specific roles in the one that prevailed in the past &#8212; authors, literary agents, <a href="http://monitortalent.com">speaking agents</a>, <a href="http://tomstites.com">editors</a>, publishers and others &#8212; are going to have to change with it. Some get this and some don&#8217;t, but I&#8217;m happy to say that the people I work with directly at this point are definitely in the getting-it category. (I&#8217;ll talk much more about this broader context in an upcoming post.)</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I&#8217;m having terrific conversations with the folks at Lulu. They aren&#8217;t the only outfit of this kind around, by any means, but I like the way they see their own part of the emerging ecosystem.</p>
<p>Incidentally, had I signed with a traditional publisher, the book would not have reached the marketplace for a year, most likely, if not even later. With Lulu, it&#8217;ll be available this summer.</p>
<h4>Rejections</h4>
<p>Editors from big publishing houses have a habit of rejecting books in what they must believe is a kind way. They say something to this effect: &#8220;It&#8217;s really interesting and we like Dan a bunch, and while it isn&#8217;t for us we&#8217;re sure it&#8217;ll find a great home with someone else.&#8221;</p>
<p>Please, folks. Any competent author would prefer this: &#8220;We didn&#8217;t like it, and here&#8217;s why&#8230;.&#8221; ﻿Honest criticism is more helpful.</p>
<p>One reason several editors did offer was a bit surprising. An editor wrote, echoing several others, &#8220;The main problem that people had was that they felt that they knew much of the information that Dan was trying to get across&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Wow. You mean that people <em>who read and publish books for a living</em> already know the value of deep and thoughtful media use? Uh, one of the major motivations for this project is the ample evidence that way too many other people <em>don&#8217;t</em> know this.</p>
<p>In my days as a newspaper reporter, I learned that the only audience that really counts is your editor. It  was a reality in the world of highly concentrated media, but no more. Any serious writer needs a good editor, but people who become your audience &#8212; and if you do it right, your collaborators &#8212; are the ones who really count.</p>
<p>Another reason for saying No had the ring of actual truth: The publisher&#8217;s publicity and marketing people &#8220;felt that the major media would avoid the book because of the criticism of their techniques.﻿&#8221; One reason I&#8217;m writing it&#8230;</p>
<h4>Lulu</h4>
<p>It was after I turned down the New York publisher&#8217;s offer that I contacted <a href="http://lulupresscenter.com/executive/view/profile/bob_young">Bob Young</a>, Lulu&#8217;s founder and CEO. Bob also started <a href="http://redhat.com">Red Hat</a>, one of the first companies to prove that it was possible to make money with open-source software by providing services, and he&#8217;s been an ardent supporter of ensuring that what we call &#8220;intellectual property&#8221; involves as many choices as possible.</p>
<p>Bob had told me about Lulu several years earlier, and in that conversation he&#8217;d suggested it would be a good fit for me someday. Now, we both thought, this might really be the time.</p>
<p>He put me in touch with <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/danwideman">Daniel Wideman</a>, who runs what Lulu calls its new &#8220;VIP Services&#8221; for established authors making the move to this kind of publishing. Daniel said he very much liked what I was trying to accomplish in this new project, and we had several further discussions. In the end it was clear to me that this would indeed be a good fit.</p>
<p>So here we go. I&#8217;ll be letting you know how all this works, by which I mean many of the details of the process.</p>
<p>Back to work&#8230;my to-do list has just gotten a whole lot longer. But it&#8217;s <em>my</em> list this time.</p>

<p>The FCC has decided that Hollywood&#8217;s copyright cartel will soon be able to <a href="http://preview.bloomberg.com/news/2010-05-07/film-studios-said-to-be-allowed-to-use-anti-piracy-technology-on-tv-sets.html">control </a><em><a href="http://preview.bloomberg.com/news/2010-05-07/film-studios-said-to-be-allowed-to-use-anti-piracy-technology-on-tv-sets.html">your</a></em><a href="http://preview.bloomberg.com/news/2010-05-07/film-studios-said-to-be-allowed-to-use-anti-piracy-technology-on-tv-sets.html"> television</a> &#8212; and ultimately much more &#8212; remotely. This is not a joke.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The FCC order “‘will allow the big firms for the first time to take control of a consumer’s TV set or set-top box, blocking viewing of a TV program or motion picture,” </em><a title="Search News" href="http://search.bloomberg.com/search?site=wnews&amp;client=wnews&amp;proxystylesheet=en10_wnews&amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;filter=p&amp;getfields=wnnis&amp;partialfields=-wnnis:NOAVSYND&amp;sort=date:D:S:d1&amp;lr=-lang_ja&amp;q=Gigi%20Sohn"><em>Gigi Sohn</em></a><em>, president of Washington-based Public Knowledge, said in a statement.﻿ </em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m old enough to remember the introduction to a long-ago TV show called the Outer Limits. Science fiction often comes true.</p>

</p>
<p>UPDATE: Cory Doctorow at BoingBoing, who has much more technical depth on these issues, <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2010/05/07/fcc-hands-hollywood.html">explains clearly</a> what&#8217;s going on &#8212; and how this is about much more than just your TV.

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>One of the favorite media outlets of the &#8220;conservative&#8221; fringe &#8212; the semi-to-full-cuckoo faction of the right wing &#8212; is WorldNetDaily, which has just run an article about journalists who declined to read a new anti-Obama book. The story, which I&#8217;m deliberately not linking to so that I don&#8217;t help its search ranking, does make one interesting point: that journalists using email with people they don&#8217;t know well should remember that their own words can be used to make them look either foolish or petty, as several do in this case.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d heard about this book and wasn&#8217;t interested in reading it for several reasons. The main one, as I told a Twitter user who pushed me to read the thing, is that whatever truth it contains, it can&#8217;t be trusted at all. How do I know that, since I haven&#8217;t read it? Because people who have read the book have noted that an entire chapter is devoted to promoting the idea that Obama is occupying the White House illegally because he either isn&#8217;t a citizen or (it gets complicated) has lineage that prevents his office-holding. This is birtherism on steroids.</p>
<p>When I pointed this out to the Twitter person, he tweeted (seriously): &#8220;Not all who question the exalted messiah is a &#8216;birther&#8217;. Love how libs shut down discourse w/ BS buzzwords. &#8220;</p>
<p>No, I shut down discourse, first, when people make the ridiculous assumption that I regard Obama as an exalted messiah; anyone who&#8217;s read what I&#8217;ve written and Tweeted about his extension of the Bush-era civil liberties abuses, among other things, would understand that. I also shut down conversations when the other parties use over-the-top language to push their own political agenda without regard to what I&#8217;m actually saying.</p>
<p>Again, it&#8217;s simple: An author who pushes birtherism as a basic part of his anti-Obama tract loses me before he starts.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>David Carr, media columnist for the New York Times, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/03/business/media/03carr.html?ref=business">took critical note</a> this week of arrogant behavior at Apple. Perhaps unsurprisingly, given the myopia that pervades his organization about its own dealings with Apple, he missed a crucial part of the story.</p>
<p>Carr, whom I like and respect enormously, gets so much right. He connects some dots that his and other news organizations, particularly Wired, had been creating in their journalism &#8212; and not just about the outrageous <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5524843/police-seize-jason-chens-computers">invasion of a journalist&#8217;s home</a>, plus the confiscation of his computing gear, to further an almost certainly Apple-inspired investigation. This, you&#8217;ll recall, occurred after an employee lost an iPhone prototype, which was then purchased by Gawker in the process of doing a much talked-about article.</p>
<p>(Whether Gawker Media was right or wrong to pay for the device isn&#8217;t the topic here; I don&#8217;t have to like the way they did their journalism to vehemently object to the abuses by the authorities, who should have gotten a subpoena instead of a search warrant; their actions were an <a href="http://www.firstamendmentcoalition.org/2010/04/digital-strip-search-case-of-lost-iphone-prototype-shows-the-danger-of-using-search-warrant-to-seize-journalists-information/">attack on journalism</a>, a flagrant one.)</p>
<p>The dots Carr connects amount to what anyone who&#8217;s paid attention to Apple has known for years: Apple makes great gadgets and software, but it is secretive, manipulative and capricious in the way it deals with everyone outside its high walls &#8212; and it plainly aims to exert absolute control over what it aims to make the world&#8217;s next major computing and communications platform.</p>
<p>Communications means media. Carr notices, at one point, that Apple is becoming a media company as he cites Apple&#8217;s dictatorial handling of the ecosystem that uses the iPhone operating system, which controls the iPhone, iPod touch and iPad.</p>
<p>Carr can&#8217;t find a pattern in the way Apple decides which content-based apps get approved and rejected. I can: It&#8217;s a pattern of a single company making all the decisions. Carr does say it makes him &#8220;queasy&#8221; and notes that it&#8217;s part of a closed-ecosystem method Apple has chosen for its newer devices. He writes:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Apple’s behavior and choices in the Gizmodo affair threaten to interrupt the séance between the company and an adoring press, who have looked past all the frantic secrecy and reverently stared in wonder at what was eventually revealed behind the curtain.</em></p>
<p><em>The media’s crush on Apple has always been an unrequited love affair. The company has a few familiars in the press whom it favors, but Apple has “no comment” programmed on a macro key. The company has unsuccessfully sued bloggers who, it believed, had punctured its veil of secrecy, and important tech news organizations like Wired have been shut out as a result of coverage deemed ill-mannered. </em></p></blockquote>
<p><em> </em>When I read that, I thought, Aha, now he&#8217;s going to address his own organization&#8217;s flagrant questions of integrity involving Apple &#8212; and look at an issue I and a number of others have raised about Apple and journalism. Namely: Why are news organizations, creating iPad apps at a rapid rate, throwing themselves into the arms of a company that <em>unilaterally reserves the right to reject or remove the journalism from its platform</em> if it doesn&#8217;t like what it sees.</p>
<p>Surely this would be worth raising an eyebrow? You won&#8217;t find a word in Carr&#8217;s column even wondering if journalism organizations are violating basic principles this way.</p>
<p>The questions are (or should be) more pointed in the specific case of the Times and its dealings with Apple. Their relationship looks so close on the surface that it <a href="http://mediactive.com/2010/04/08/complicating-relationships-in-media-apple-ny-times-dealings-raise-questions/">gives the appearance</a> of a cross-promotional campaign for each others&#8217; products. Might it have been useful for Carr to ask his own bosses to address any of this? When I asked, they stonewalled until issuing a <a href="http://mediactive.com/2010/04/16/fiores-ipad-rejection-harbinger-of-bigger-story/">&#8220;no comment&#8221;</a> to my specific questions. This was curious: Last summer, when Apple was similarly promoting the Times in its pre-release campaign for an iPhone model, a Times spokesperson specifically <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2009/07/why-the-new-york-times-is-crowing-about-apples-marketing-embrace/">denied to the Nieman Journalism Lab</a> that there was any business relationship, saying Apple had asked for permission, happily granted, to feature the news organization in its promotion. In that context, a &#8220;no comment&#8221; is at least an interesting shift in position. Maybe Carr could have asked if something had changed?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a rhetorical question, of course, just like the other ones I&#8217;m asking about how far Carr&#8217;s column took these issues. I don&#8217;t really expect him to push his bosses as hard as I&#8217;m suggesting he might. He&#8217;s an employee, and employees of news organizations &#8212; institutions whose arrogance matches that of Wall Street banks &#8212; know just how far they can go, which isn&#8217;t very far, in asking of themselves that which they demand of others.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I managed to puzzle some of my Twitter followers this weekend, especially yesterday, when I posted a slew of tweets from the annual meeting of <a href="http://berkshirehathaway">Berkshire Hathaway</a>, a company in which I&#8217;m a shareholder. I also had a media pass, which gave me admission to a press conference held by the company&#8217;s two senior leaders, Warren Buffett and Charles Munger.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll talk about Berkshire Hathaway, Buffett and Munger in a separate post on my personal blog. It seems appropriate here, however, to chat briefly about the pros and cons of live-blogging versus live-tweeting, etc.</p>
<p>My regular Twitter followers were definitely not expecting the fire hose from me; normally I post anywhere from zero to a dozen or so Tweets a day, usually in the 6-9 range. Suddenly <a href="http://twitter.com/dangillmor">my Twitter stream</a> turned into a torrent, and it came as a surprise to some followers.</p>
<p>One follower and good friend shot me an email asking, basically, WTF I was doing. I explained and said it was an experiment, probably a one-off. He replied, in turn, that he was kind of enjoying it, but still&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m fairly sure it <em>was</em> a one-time affair, and here&#8217;s why:</p>
<p>Live-tweeting strikes me as the wrong tool for this kind of task. It&#8217;s an impressionistic medium, not a deep one, at least so far in its history. If I&#8217;m going to keep notes for you about an event I&#8217;m witnessing, I&#8217;d prefer that you be able to find them easily as I write them &#8212; but also to find them in one place when it&#8217;s over. </p>
<p>The plus side of live-tweeting stems not just from what one person writes, but very much as well from others&#8217; contributions to a running group observation and commentary. Hashtags make this easy. (I posted the Berkshire material with the <a href="http://twitter.com/#search?q=%23brk2010">#brk2010 hashtag</a>, which a number of other journalists were using.) Following a group&#8217;s blog posts is, due to the nature of <em>that</em> medium, more difficult.</p>
<p>Other tools for this task include the excellent <a href="http://coveritlive.com">CoverItLive</a>, which I&#8217;ll try sometime soon at an event I find newsworthy enough. One advantage of CoverItLive is the ability of several people to simultaneously add to the stream. (Is there a good open-source tool or WordPress plug-in that does the same things or has significant portion of the same features?)</p>
<p>But I&#8217;m leaning toward making it simple, and just using a blog from now on. I&#8217;d rather keep stuff on my own site, thank you, than turn it over to another company and the ever-morphing terms of service we see from providers of all kinds.</p>
<p>One worry this weekend turned out not to be a big deal: annoying people sufficiently that they&#8217;d unfollow me. A few did, especially during the Sunday press conference. Yet more started following at the same time, and the day left me with a net gain.</p>
<p>Bottom line: Next time I do something like this, I&#8217;ll probably live-blog and point to it from Twitter.</p>
<p>Of course, I&#8217;m still thinking about all this, and reserve the right to change my mind. More than once&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>UPDATED</p>
<p>The New York Times, after noting that Apple reversed its arbitrary banning of an editorial cartoonist&#8217;s iPhone app,  reports that an association representing cartoonists <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/26/business/media/26app.html?src=twt&#038;twt=NYTimesAd"> is lobbying for the company to change its rules for humorous, politically charged apps.</a>. </p>
<p>I think we need a cartoon for this. It would show the cartoonists storming the gates at Infinite Loop in Cupertino, with the editors and reporters at their newspapers nowhere in sight as they refuse, almost universally, to address the larger issue of turning over their journalism to a capricious owner of an ecosystem in which they have no control.</p>
<p>Maybe <a href="http://www.markfiore.com/">Mark Fiore</a> could create it. He knows the issue intimately.</p>
<p>UPDATE: Or maybe not. As Molly Wood <a href="http://twitter.com/mollywood/statuses/12864584261">notes</a>, Fiore &#8220;resubmitted his app, which is now &#8216;accepted.&#8217; I wish he&#8217;d told Apple to shove off.&#8221; Me, too.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>UPDATED</p>
<p>A few days ago, following up on questions I&#8217;ve asked a number of other news organizations about their relationships with Apple, the Washington Post&#8217;s Rob Pegoraro put a query to his bosses &#8212; and, unlike me with any traditional news company (including his), got an answer.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the operative quote from his story today, entitled &#8220;<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/04/23/AR2010042302127_2.html">App rejected? There&#8217;s a rule for that</a>&#8221; &#8212;</p>
<blockquote><p><em>So, can Apple remove news organizations&#8217; apps for their content? Washington Post spokeswoman Kris Coratti wrote that &#8220;this is our understanding&#8221;; National Public Radio&#8217;s Danielle Deabler agreed but said NPR saw no evidence that Apple wanted to do such a thing. Publicists for the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, CNN and USA Today declined to comment or did not reply to e-mails.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>We now have confirmation from two of America&#8217;s most respected news organizations &#8212; the Post and NPR &#8212; that they willingly participate in a distribution/access ecosystem where the company that owns it can remove their journalism from that system for any reason it chooses.</p>
<p>I suspect that the spokeswomen for the Post and NPR have technically violated the terms of their companies&#8217; developers agreements with Apple even by saying that much. Which is, of course, part of the problem.</p>
<p>Anyway, kudos to Pegoraro, who has shown more spine than his colleagues at other news organizations. From all appearances, they&#8217;re just hoping this will all go away. It won&#8217;t.</p>
<p>UPDATE: At the <a href="http://online.journalism.utexas.edu/">International Symposium on Online Journalism</a> today in Austin, I asked three panelists &#8212; from NPR, the New York Times and the Guardian &#8212; about this issue. Only NPR&#8217;s <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=97506803">Kinsey Wilson</a> responded, and he was more forthright than I&#8217;ve heard anyone be from any media company so far.</p>
<p>The situation is &#8220;not ideal,&#8221; he acknowledged. No news organization, he assumes, has the individual leverage with Apple to insist on contract terms that should be standard for people who believe in their journalism. </p>
<p>NPR, based on Wilson&#8217;s other panel comments, is creating what sounds like a multi-platform strategy: creating a back-end system that can feed to any platform. All smart news organizations are trying to move this way.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>UPDATED</p>
<p>Eleven days after I first raised the subject of the New York Times&#8217; <a href="http://mediactive.com/2010/04/08/complicating-relationships-in-media-apple-ny-times-dealings-raise-questions/">complicated relationship(s)</a> with Apple (follow-up <a href="http://mediactive.com/2010/04/16/fiores-ipad-rejection-harbinger-of-bigger-story/">here</a>), I&#8217;ve finally received an answer, of sorts. Sadly, the answer wasn&#8217;t to the questions I asked.</p>
<p>A PR person from the company, responding to one of several subsequent emails, wrote back today: &#8220;No, we are not going to comment.&#8221;</p>
<p>This stonewalling &#8212; this deliberate statement that the newspaper chooses to be opaque on matters that go to its editorial integrity &#8212; is disappointing, but unfortunately not entirely surprising. But it left me with no real choice on a decision I truly hate to make:</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve sold my small (300 shares) holding of New York Times Co. stock. I&#8217;ll be taking a loss on the transaction, but I&#8217;d never expected to make much money, if any, on my purchase in the first place; I bought NYT stock because I wanted to demonstrate my support of quality journalism.</p>
<p>For decades I&#8217;ve revered the New York Times. I still believe that it&#8217;s loaded with superb journalists. I hope it survives and thrives in a media environment that grows more challenging every day.</p>
<p>Journalism is in enough trouble as it is, and the Times&#8217; challenges are truly daunting. Arrogant non-transparency about basic integrity only makes the situation worse. So I&#8217;ll put what money I have left from this already poor investment into something else.</p>

		<p>UPDATED</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been more than a week since I asked a number of news organizations, chiefly the New York Times, to <a href="http://mediactive.com/2010/04/08/complicating-relationships-in-media-apple-ny-times-dealings-raise-questions/">answer a few questions</a> about their relationships with Apple. Specifically, I asked the Times to discuss what has become at least the appearance of a conflict of interest: Apple&#8217;s incessant promotion of the newspaper in pictures of its new iPad and highlighting of the Times&#8217; plans to make the iPad a key platform for the news organization&#8217;s journalism, combined with the paper&#8217;s relentlessly positive coverage of the device in news columns.</p>
<p>In addition, I asked the Times, the Wall Street Journal and USA Today &#8212; following up on a February posting when I asked <a href="http://mediactive.com/2010/02/24/why-journalism-organizations-should-reconsider-their-crush-on-apples-ipad/">why news organizations were running</a> into the arms of a control-freakish company &#8212; to respond to a simple question: Can Apple unilaterally disable their iPad apps if Apple decides, for any reason, that it doesn&#8217;t like the content they&#8217;re distributing? Apple has done this with many other companies&#8217; apps and holds absolute power over what appears and doesn&#8217;t appear via its app system.</p>
<p>Who responded? No one. Not even a &#8220;No comment.&#8221; This is disappointing if (sadly) usurprising, but in light of other news this week it&#8217;s downright wrong.</p>
<p>UPDATE: A Times PR person emailed, 11 days after I first contacted the company about this, that the paper is &#8220;not going to comment.&#8221; Still no word from the others or, more recently, the Washington Post.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Nieman Journalism Lab&#8217;s Laura McGann had a story that should give pause even to Apple&#8217;s biggest fanboys and girls inside the news industry. In a post entitled &#8220;<a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2010/04/mark-fiore-can-win-a-pulitzer-prize-but-he-cant-get-his-iphone-cartoon-app-past-apples-satire-police/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+NiemanJournalismLab+%28Nieman+Journalism+Lab%29&amp;utm_content=G">Mark Fiore can win a Pulitzer Prize, but he can’t get his iPhone cartoon app past Apple’s satire police</a>,&#8221; she wrote of the newly minted Pulitzer winner in the cartooning category:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>In December, Apple rejected his iPhone app, NewsToons, because, as Apple put it, his satire ‘ridicules public figures,’ a violation of the iPhone Developer Program License Agreement, which bars any apps whose content in ‘Apple’s reasonable judgement may be found objectionable, for example, materials that may be considered obscene, pornographic, or defamatory.’</em></p></blockquote>
<p>My disdain for Apple&#8217;s tactics grows with almost week &#8212; and I&#8217;ll be saying more about that in a separate posting &#8212; but Apple isn&#8217;t the issue here. This is about journalism integrity, and the absolute lack of transparency America&#8217;s top news organizations are demonstrating by blowing off a totally reasonable question that these news people refuse to raise in their own pages to any serious degree. (The Times&#8217; refusal to discuss its wider relationship with Apple is even more discouraging, and I&#8217;m getting close to selling my small stock holding to demonstrate my disgust with an organization I once absolutely revered.)</p>
<p>I was glad to see Columbia Journalism Review&#8217;s Ryan Chittum pursue this yesterday when he wrote, &#8220;<a href="http://www.cjr.org/the_audit/its_time_for_the_press_to_push.php">It’s Time for the Press to Push Back Against Apple</a>.&#8221; Will anyone? The early signs aren&#8217;t encouraging.</p>
<p>In a Tweet today, <a href="http://publish2.com">Publish2</a>&#8216;s Scott Karp <a href="http://twitter.com/scottkarp/status/12289301748">asked</a>, &#8220;Do you think news orgs should refuse to create apps for iPad/iPhone?&#8221; It&#8217;s the right question.</p>
<p>The answer is a qualified no. While I won&#8217;t personally want to participate as a journalist in an ecosystem where one company controls content in this way, I can understand why others might &#8212; but any self-respecting journalist would want to have absolute, in-writing guarantees that Apple could not in any way interfere with the journalism.</p>
<p>I see no sign of this. And I&#8217;m disgusted with journalists who participate in this system or ignore its implications, or both.</p>
