	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>More than 10 weeks since it published an editorialÂ <a href="../2009/10/24/washington-post-editorial-remains-uncorrected/">based on a false premise</a>, the Washington Post has neither acknowledged nor corrected its mistake.</p>
<p>Then again, the same editorial page routinely publishes op-ed columns that are not truthful. Maybe we shouldn&#8217;t be surprised when the people who write the unsigned editorials do the same.</p>
<p>In any event, the Post&#8217;s refusal to even address this error &#8212; I&#8217;ve expressed my disgust to the newspaper&#8217;s ombudsman, who says the editorial page is off limits for his reviews &#8212; is disgraceful.</p>

		<p><a href="http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/Screen-shot-2009-12-13-at-10.00.12-AM1.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-1131 alignnone" title="Facebook-delete-account-screen" src="http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/Screen-shot-2009-12-13-at-10.00.12-AM1.png" alt="Facebook-delete-account-screen" width="510" height="171" srcset="http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/Screen-shot-2009-12-13-at-10.00.12-AM1.png 510w, http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/Screen-shot-2009-12-13-at-10.00.12-AM1-300x100.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px" /></a></p>
<p>Like many other people, I have a Facebook account. One reason is to keep track of what&#8217;s happening in the planet&#8217;s largest social network, including what application developers and users are doing there.</p>
<p>Another is that some of my friends &#8212; actual friends &#8212; are using the site. Facebook helps me stay in touch.</p>
<p>But the <a href="http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2009/12/facebooks-new-privacy-changes-good-bad-and-ugly">privacy fiasco</a> of the past few days has left me feeling that I really can&#8217;t entirely trust Facebook, even with the limited amount of things I&#8217;ve said and done on the site since I got an account several years ago. Maybe I&#8217;m over-reacting &#8212; and I continue to admire the company&#8217;s accomplishments in many other ways &#8212; but that&#8217;s just the way it is.</p>
<p>Why don&#8217;t I feel safe and sound in their benevolent hands? Because although some of the changes they&#8217;ve made in their privacy settings are actually helpful, they are suggesting that users share much more of their data and other information, much more widely than ever. Facebook&#8217;s extremely smart leaders know perfectly well that the majority of users are likely to accept these suggestions, because most people say yes to whatever the default settings are in any application.</p>
<p>I wasn&#8217;t very happy with my Facebook situation in any case. Early on, I said yes to just about everyone who asked me to &#8220;friend&#8221; them, including people barely knew and some I didn&#8217;t know at all.</p>
<p>The privacy changes &#8212; and my continuing uncertainty, given the number of pages you have to look at to modify your settings &#8212; made me realize I&#8217;d rather take fewer chances. So I&#8217;ve made a fairly drastic change.</p>
<p>This morning, I deleted my account. Then I started a new one.</p>
<p>Actually, I scheduled the old one for deletion several weeks from now, which is all Facebook allows. The company figures, perhaps correctly, that some people will have made this decision rashly and wants to give them a way to reconsider. And it&#8217;s clearly in Facebook&#8217;s interest to avoid as many cancellations as possible for business reasons.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t easy to figure out how to delete the account, which no doubt is part of the company&#8217;s strategy, too. If you go to your Settings page, the only option in this realm is to &#8220;deactivate,&#8221; not delete.</p>
<p>But a little searching on the site turns up this Facebook Group called <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=16929680703">&#8220;How to permanently delete your facebok account&#8221;</a> (more than 35,000 members) &#8212; which in turn reveals <a href="http://www.facebook.com/help/contact.php?show_form=delete_account">this link</a> to a delete-account form.</p>
<p>Before I did the actual deletion, however, I went to my Account Settings and opened up the Username option. I&#8217;d previously set my username to &#8220;dangillmor&#8221; so my Facebook URL would be facebook.com/dangillmor, and wanted to be able to use that again. I changed the username to something else, and only then did I delete the account.</p>
<p>Then I started a new account, using a different email address, and set the username to match the old one.</p>
<p>Next up was a check of the default privacy settings for new users. They&#8217;re pretty <em>un-private</em>, in my view, sharing way too much with people you don&#8217;t know. I systematically went through the various screens &#8212; Facebook makes this chore both annoying and obscure, perhaps on purpose &#8212; to ratchet down the settings to something I can live with.</p>
<p>Look, we all know what is Facebook&#8217;s best interest: exposing to search engines and advertisers the largest possible number of pages by among the largest number of people willing to create stuff and make it all public. Marketers drool at what they can do at Facebook if the company will only let them, and Facebook&#8217;s entirely rational goal, like almost every other Internet company&#8217;s, is to make profits in almost any way it can. What&#8217;s in the corporate interest, however, doesn&#8217;t necessarily match what&#8217;s in my interest, or yours.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;m still at facebook.com/dangillmor &#8212; though my <em>real</em> Web homebase is <a href="http://dangillmor.com">dangillmor.com</a> &#8212; with just two Facebook friends at the moment. I&#8217;ll be adding more, but not in any hasty way.</p>
<p>UPDATE: Wired News explains <a href="http://howto.wired.com/wiki/Un-Facebook_Yourself">How to UnFacebook Yourself</a>.</p>
<p>And Jason Calacanis asks, <a href="http://calacanis.com/2009/12/13/is-facebook-unethical-clueless-or-unlucky/">&#8220;Is Facebook Unethical, Clueless or Unlucky?&#8221;</a> I vote mainly for the first.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>UPDATED</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s Washington Post editorial pages feature an &#8220;op-ed&#8221; column entitled <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/12/08/AR2009120803402.html?hpid=opinionsbox1">Sarah Palin on the politicization of the Copenhagen climate conference</a>. Never mind that the column is <a href="http://politics.theatlantic.com/2009/12/palins_boycott_copenhagen_op-ed_annotated.php">full of falsehoods</a>; the Post and most other papers often run letters, op-ed columns and editorials that contain falsehoods. (Sometimes they correct the errors; often <a href="http://mediactive.com/2009/12/07/nearly-2-months-since-major-washington-post-error-no-correction/">they</a> <a href="http://mediactive.com/2009/11/24/that-hallowed-standard-of-accuracy-oops/">don&#8217;t</a>.)</p>
<p>My issue here is with the column&#8217;s tagline:<br />
<em><br />
<blockquote>The writer was the 2008 Republican nominee for vice president and governor of Alaska from 2006 to 2009.</p></blockquote>
<p></em><br />
Does anyone who understands media and PR really buy this &#8212; the notion that Palin wrote the column in question? Of course not.</p>
<p>Op-ed pieces that run under the bylines of famous politicians, celebrities and business people are almost never written by those people, just as they rarely write their autobiographies, even first drafts, by themselves. They don&#8217;t have time. Their staffers and PR people research and write the pieces.</p>
<p>Society has a serious blind spot about this kind of thing &#8212; and applies a pernicious double standard. If we catch a student paying someone to write his or her paper for a class, we give the student an F. Or, in some cases (like a journalism school), we might even ask the student to leave.</p>
<p>So why do newspaper editors think it&#8217;s fine to wink at obvious deception? They could put a stop to the fiction tomorrow, but probably won&#8217;t. The continuing lure of &#8220;free content,&#8221; especially with famous names at the top, is an ingrained habit, however wrong.</p>
<p>Ghost-written op-eds are often compared with speechwriter-written speeches. Since we all know that most famous people don&#8217;t write their own lines for speeches, goes this logic, we should assume the same with a byline &#8212; whether on a book or an op-ed.</p>
<p>Call me naive, but I&#8217;d like to hold journalists to a slightly higher standard. Newspapers have given away enough of their credibility in recent times. Maybe this is a place to regain a little.</p>
<p>UPDATE: A Twitter commenter asked, essentially, what&#8217;s the harm if everyone knows it&#8217;s happening. First, not everyone does know. Sure, media-savvy people are well aware of the fakery. I&#8217;m not certain that <em>everyone</em> takes for granted that these are ghost-written, however.</p>
<p>Again, the point is not that celebrity politicians are going to stop doing this. It&#8217;s that newspapers, which should care about little things like credibility, should stop being complicit in the deception. Even if it turns out to be true that everyone knows, it&#8217;s still wrong.</p>

<p>Users of the iPhone in the U.S. have been plaugued by AT&amp;T&#8217;s lousy network, but now the telecom company is crowdsourcing what it hopes will help identify the worst parts of the network. It can&#8217;t tell if your call has been dropped on purpose &#8212; that is, you hung up &#8212; or whether it dropped because of the crappy network. So it&#8217;s <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2009/12/iphone-app-reports-dropped-calls-poor-voice-quality-to-att/">asking users</a> for help, according to Wired News.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a media point to this. AT&amp;T understands the value of its customers&#8217; collective knowledge. Journalists are still missing it, for the most part.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>UPDATED</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/06/business/media/06animate.html?hp"><img style="margin-top: 2px; margin-bottom: 2px; margin-left: 4px; margin-right: 4px; border: 0px initial initial;" src="http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/animation-woods1.png" border="0" alt="animation woods.png" width="238" height="145" align="right" /></a>On the front page of Sunday&#8217;s print edition and home page of the online edition, the New York Times is clucking about an animation it puts in the category of &#8220;Maybe Journalism.&#8221; The widely seen video, from a Hong Kong media company, purportsÂ to show what transpired between Tiger Woods and his wife in the recent incident that has dominated our celebrity-addled news programming lately.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the top of the Times&#8217; story, entitled <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/06/business/media/06animate.html?hp">&#8220;In Animated Videos, News and Guesswork Mix&#8221;</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Welcome to the new world of Maybe Journalism â a best guess at the news as it might well have been, rendered as a video game and built on a bed of pure surmise. </em></p>
<p><em>A computer-generated ânews reportâ of the Tiger Woods S.U.V. crash â complete with a robotic-looking simulation of Mr. Woodsâs wife chasing him with a golf club â has become a top global online video of the moment, perhaps offering a glimpse at the future of journalism, tabloid division. (No matter that the police said she was using the club to release Mr. Woods from the car.)</em></p>
<p><em> </em><em>The minute-and-a-half-long digitally animated piece was created by Next Media, a Hong Kong-based company with gossipy newspapers in Hong Kong and Taiwan. The video is one of more than 20 the company releases a day, often depicting events that no journalist actually witnessed â and that may not have even occurred. </em></p></blockquote>
<p>A glimpse at journalism&#8217;s future, tabloid division? How about journalism&#8217;s present, in a somewhat different form?</p>
<p>It looks more to me like the latter. Next Media is following in the footsteps of what American journalism has made a trademark, particularly in the book, magazine and tabloid-TV businesses. Modern books about politics and business, in particular, are loaded with direct quotes and minute details of events &#8220;no journalist actually witnessed.&#8221;</p>
<p>These techniques have a purpose. They&#8217;re designed at least as much to capture and hold the attention of print and video audiences as to enlighten them.</p>
<p>I acknowledge that this is a bit of a stretch. I&#8217;m emphatically not saying that fly-on-the-wall print accounts, which journalists claim are based on extensive interviews with principals, are close to the same thing as this maybe-it-happened video.</p>
<p>I am saying that when people ask you to trust their depictions of &#8220;events that no journalist actually witnessed &#8212; and that may not have even occurred,&#8221; you take them with a serious grain of salt.</p>
<p>Some of this stuff has been going on for decades. In 1965Â Truman Capote called his masterwork &#8212; <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Cold_Blood">In Cold Blood</a></em>, about the killing of a Kansas family and the killers&#8217; path to their executions &#8212; a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/books/97/12/28/home/capote-interview.html">&#8220;nonfiction novel&#8221;</a>. He helped create a new form of literature. He also helped spark the form of journalism that has become so standard now: the fly-on-the-wall pretense that pervades so much of what we see.</p>
<p>Critics later questioned Capote&#8217;s motives and methods, and ultimately the basic honesty of the book. But he was honest at least in the sense that he acknowledged that he was writing a novel, and more rigorous as a reporter than a lot of modern journalists even pretend to be. (Norman Mailer also called his brilliant book about a real crime, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/books/97/05/04/reviews/mailer-song.html">The Executioner&#8217;s Song</a>, a novel.)</p>
<p>The Washington Post&#8217;s Bob Woodward is the most famous current practitioner of the nonfiction novel, though he&#8217;d undoubtedly insist that his work is pure journalism. I don&#8217;t trust a thing he writes, and haven&#8217;t for some time.</p>
<p>Woodward&#8217;s books are loaded with direct quotations of people he says he interviewed, and some he didn&#8217;t. How can you have faith, beyond assuming that he&#8217;s telling the truth Â when he says he has it right, that it <em>is</em> right? Why should you?</p>
<p>Now everybody, or seemingly everybody, follows the Woodward lead. Novelistic journalism is the order of our times. But I&#8217;m convinced it&#8217;s one the reasons people have concluded, rationally, that they can&#8217;t really believe anything anymore.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/imagepages/2009/12/06/world/06reconstruct-graphic.html"><img style="margin-top: 2px; margin-bottom: 2px; margin-left: 4px; margin-right: 4px; border: 0px initial initial;" src="http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/situation-room-obama.png" border="0" alt="situation room obama.png" width="191" height="147" align="left" /></a>Newspapers, too, play the fly-on-the-wall game. Consider what the Times itself did today.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Maybe Journalism&#8221; piece runs at the bottom of the front page, while at the top is <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/06/world/asia/06reconstruct.html?hp=&amp;pagewanted=all">a long story</a> about how President Obama, after long consultations with advisors, reached his decision to escalate the war in Afghanistan. The story is based, says the reporter, on &#8220;dozens of interviews with participants as well as a review of notes some of them took during Mr. Obamaâs 10 meetings with his national security team. Most of those interviewed spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, but their accounts have been matched against those of other participants wherever possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>We readers are still being asked to trust the word of people who violated the confidentiality of the White House Situation Room and other internal deliberations. I tend to believe the overall thrust of the story &#8212; that Obama and his team struggled mightily with this decision &#8212; but I don&#8217;t have any faith in most of the particulars, including the anonymously sourced direct quotes of the president and others in the deliberations.</p>
<p>Why is this not, in the words of the story about the Hong Kong animators, &#8220;depicting events that no journalist actually witnessed â and that may not have even occurred&#8221;?</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t the first draft of history. It&#8217;s the first draft of someone&#8217;s nonfiction novel on the Obama presidency.</p>
<p><em>(<a href="http://dangillmor.com/about">Disclosure</a>: I own a small number of shares in the New York Times Co. They&#8217;re worth a lot less than I paid for them. Updated to make clearer that I&#8217;m not equating in any apples-to-apples way the animations and the fly on wall journalism.)</em></p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>So it&#8217;s official. Comcast has <a href="http://news.google.com/news?q=comcast+nbc&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=GeoXS86pI5T8tQPCh92lDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=news_group&amp;ct=title&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBIQsQQwAA">announced its intention to buy NBC Universal</a> from GE. The danger of this cannot be overstated, but it could actually be the catalyst for a policy conversation the nation desperately needs to hold.</p>
<p>A Comcast-NBC combination is brazenly anti-competitve and anti-democratic.  It would give one company far too much ownership over not just professionally produced media but also the ways media consumers can receive it.</p>
<p>Worse, if approved, it could mark the tipping point in Big Media&#8217;s push to take control over the Internet itself. That&#8217;s where we need to focus our attention.</p>
<p>We can come out of this the right way if the announced deal prompts Congress to stop ducking <em>the</em> key media consolidation issue of our time. If we can use data networks the way we choose, the traditional fears about media consolidation &#8212; the concentration of mass media in the hands of a few immensely powerful corporations &#8212; lessen over time. They&#8217;re still worth worrying about, but not as much.</p>
<p>No, the issue now is the truly scary media consolidation we face: the &#8220;broadband&#8221; duopoly&#8217;s increasing control over what we can do with <em>our</em> media. The cable and phone giants are determined to decide what bits get delivered in what order, at what speed and at what time &#8212; if they get delivered at all &#8212; to the people who want them.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been obvious for years that a day like this was coming. From <em><a href="http://wethemedia.oreilly.com">We the Media</a></em> in 2004 (and I was hardly the first person to notice):</p>
<blockquote><p><em>In a world where we may end up with one, two, or at most three broadband telecommunications providers in any given community, the end-to-end principle is in serious jeopardy. Should giant telecommunications companiesânamely cable and local phone providersâhave vertical control over everything from the data transport to the content itself? For example, as I was writing this book, Comcast, the cable monopoly in my area, was trying to buy Disney. The attempt failed. If this happened, Comcast could have decided to deliver Disneyâs content online more quickly than someone elseâs, discriminating on the basis of financial considerations. Such a regime would have been a disaster for the unimpeded flow of information. We should insist on a more horizontal system, in which the owner of the pipe is obliged to provide interconnections to competing serÂ­vices. Unfortunately, todayâs regulatory and political power broÂ­kers lean in the wrong direction.</em></p>
<p><em>&#8230;</em></p>
<p><em>The cable and phone companies have shown again and again that they abuse their power. They are historical monopoÂ­lies with control over vast territories given to them by governÂ­ments. But they used to be regulated monopolies. Increasingly, they are freeing themselves of regulation.</em></p>
<p><em>&#8230;</p>
<p>The threat is still more theoretical than real, at least in the United States. People in China, where the governÂ­ment censors Internet content, know firsthand the danger of centralized choke points.</p>
<p></em></p></blockquote>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p>So now it&#8217;s real. What can we do?</p>
<p>First, recognize how networked media work, or should. In the traditional mass media days, people who worked for big businesses created media and distributed it; they manufactured stuff and put it in trucks, or broadcast it over one-way, one-to-many distributions systems.</p>
<p>In an Inter-networked world we create stuff, and then <em>we make it available, and other people come and get it</em>. People at the edges of networks make the decisions that matter, not the people who provide the data pipes. That&#8217;s how it should work, at any rate.</p>
<p>Second, this suggests we shouldn&#8217;t  obsess over what sound like huge issues but are actually peripheral. Specifically, I don&#8217;t care that much if Big Content ends up in just a few hands, as long as the rest of us can a) keep creating our own media and b) make it available on distributed networks without having to pay unjust toll charges.</p>
<p>Comcast has already started pushing its Internet users toward an entirely artificial pricing, putting usage caps on packet-switched data services, i.e. the Internet, for heavy users of data-rich applications, notably video. This has been a conflict of interest from the start, given that Comcast is primarily a video-delivery company for Big Content. Comcast&#8217;s data pipes could be used to provide much greater Internet bandwidth, but Comcast chooses to limit that kind of data, and not just for technical reasons.</p>
<p>Now that it would own one of the major Big Content companies, the conflicts of interest would expand in dramatic and obvious ways on the video side. I&#8217;m sure the other Big Content players can fend for themselves when it comes to keeping their cable channels; they have lots of financial and lobbying clout.</p>
<p>But the rest of us, especially the younger people who should be entering a data-networked world of nearly unlimited media choices, have less power. And we&#8217;re likely to be the ones, in the end, who lose the most.</p>
<p>Why? Because it will be in Comcast&#8217;s financial interest to clamp down as much as possible on Internet data use when it conflicts with its cable-TV business, which is to say on a constant basis.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that Comcast wouldn&#8217;t be the first company to have this kind of vertical content and distribution structure. Time Warner owns some cable franchises along with CNN and other media properties; Cablevision has its own content business. Phone companies have some projects under way, too.</p>
<p>The greater threat is where this deal would lead. It would set off a rush of other buyouts, moving more Big Content under the wings of the rest of the telecom companies. They&#8217;ll have the same incentives to restrict data usage, and unless they&#8217;re told not to do this by people who can make it stick, that&#8217;s exactly what they&#8217;ll do.</p>
<p>Understand this: The telecom companies are trying to remake the Internet into a form of cable television. It&#8217;s not because they&#8217;re evil, though they often behave in evil ways, but because it would be good business &#8212; for them, and the hell with the rest of us.</p>
<p>So where does Congress come into the picture? Everywhere, obviously, but I wish I had confidence in lawmakers&#8217; willingness to address this.</p>
<p>Keep in mind how people are elected today: for the most part, despite progress in Internet organizing and fundraising, via television advertising. Will Congress take on companies that control the biggest media? Have the lawmakers ever done this, at least in recent times? Nope.</p>
<p>Please be clear on what&#8217;s at stake: We are heading toward a level of media control that, if the telecom companies succeed in achieving it, will threaten every bit of the work I and many others have been doing for the past decade.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll say it again: This is <em>the</em> media-consolidation issue of the early 21st Century. If you care, call and/or write your member of Congress, before it&#8217;s too late.</p>

		<p>John Byrne, former editor of BusinessWeek, who&#8217;s starting a <a href="http://www.c-changemedia.com/2009/11/why-incumbent-media-will-continue-to.html">new venture</a>:<br />
<em><br />
<blockquote>I passionately believe that the future of media is digital and that newcomers have tremendous advantages over incumbents. Most of traditional media remains in a complete meltdown, dragged down by high costs, old ways of thinking, and legacy work processes. As tough as the past three years have been for traditional media, the next three are going to be nothing less than brutal: more closures, greater losses, increasing layoffs of highly talented journalists and editors.</p>
<p>Thatâs also why weâre going to see a media boom in the next three years, the launch of tens of thousands of new media entrepreneurs on the Internet. Many of them will fail, but many more will flourish and replace the brands our fathers and grandfathers grew up with. The success of Huffington Post, Politico, Drudge, GigaOm, TechCrunch, and other media enterprises on the web have shown us a path forward. But itâs still very early days and the new followers are going to have lots of advantages over the first movers. Iâm thrilled and excited to be part of this revolution.</p></blockquote>

		<p>UPDATED</p>
<p>As everyone knows, the nation&#8217;s scam artists, monopolists and market-riggers have all gone into hibernation during the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. This has given the Federal Trade Commission the breathing room it needs to intercede in an arena where its role is, at best, unclear.</p>
<p>This week, the commission is holding a two-day workshop entitled <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/opp/workshops/news/index.shtml">How Will Journalism Survive the Internet Age?</a> &#8212; the purpose of which is &#8220;to explore how the Internet has affected journalism.&#8221;</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/opp/workshops/news/agenda.pdf">agenda</a> &#8212; bizarrely available only in PDF format; would someone at the agency who has a clue kindly tell the public-affairs people that it&#8217;s okay to post such things in HTML? &#8212; suggests great breadth. Speakers include old-guard media barons like Rupert Murdoch and budding barons like Arianna Huffington, but also many of the traditional and new-media folks whose names show up again and again in places like Jim <a href="http://www.poynter.org/column.asp?id=45">Romenesko</a>&#8216;s Poynter blog. It&#8217;s an impressive list (and, disclosure, includes a bunch of friends as well as two university colleagues).</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll also note, however, that the schedule assures little depth. The time slots are arranged in a rapid-fire manner, with keynote-ish speakers having no real time to offer much more than their standard-issue talking points. Panels are even more lickety-split, with nine members in 90 minutes; let&#8217;s see, that&#8217;s about 8 minutes each plus introductions and no audience Q&amp;A, or 6 minutes each if you want to (very briefly) include the audience.</p>
<p>The event comes under the FTC&#8217;s Office of Policy Planning. Here&#8217;s <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/opp/about.shtm">its mission</a>:<br />
<em><br />
</em></p>
<blockquote><p><em>The Office of Policy Planning assists the Commission to develop and implement long-range competition and consumer protection policy initiatives and advises staff on cases raising new or complex policy and legal issues.</em></p>
<p><em>One of the Office of Policy Planning&#8217;s primary roles involves competition advocacy, submitting filings supporting competition principles to state legislatures, regulatory boards, and officials; state and federal courts; other federal agencies; and professional organizations. The Office also organizes public workshops and issues reports on cutting-edge competition and consumer protection topics, addressing questions of substantive antitrust law, industry-specific practices, and significant national and international policy debates.</em></p>
<p><em>In addition to the Office of Policy Planning, several offices throughout the Commission, including the Bureau of Competitionâs Office of Policy and Coordination and the Policy Studies unit within the Office of the General Counsel, also provide policy advice.</em></p></blockquote>

This has what to do with journalism, exactly?</p>
<p>Ah, we learn more in a <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/os/2009/09/090930mediaworkshopnotice.pdf">Federal Register Notice</a> (also PDF-only, naturally). The notice observes, in a promising start, that the Internet has created unparalleled possibilities.</p>
<p>The commission could have stopped there, and not bothered to hold the workshop. It could have recognized that we&#8217;re in the early days of a transition from one set of business models (most of which have not been very competitive) to an emerging, hyper-competitive sphere. There&#8217;s never been more reason for optimism than there is today, given the massive amount of journalistic and business experimentation going on all around us.</p>
<p>But the commission staff has much to fret about, spurred in large part by the incessant whining of the newspaper industry in recent times. (Could it also have been influenced by the fact that the FTC chairman is <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/commissioners/leibowitz/index.shtml">married</a> to a Washington Post <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">reporter</span> columnist? No, this obviously had absolutely no bearing on anything.) The commission has discovered that the advertising model which once supported many kinds of journalism has eroded. Quoting several economists, the workshop notice says &#8220;public affairs reporting may indeed be particularly subject to market failure.&#8221;</p>
<p>Market failure? What about the market failure &#8212; which as far as I can tell never got any attention from a succession of FTC people during the past half-century &#8212; of the monopolies and oligopolies created by media organizations during that period? The public affairs journalism was, for the most part, a modest spinoff of the extortionate advertising prices they charged when they had near-absolute market power to charge anything they wished. Only when there&#8217;s real competition does the FTC get interested.</p>
<p>The commission, inevitably, is asking for opinions on whether federal taxpayers should subsidize journalism more directly than the indirect subsidies of low postal rates for print; giveaways of publicly owned airwaves (spectrum) to broadcasters; the odious &#8220;Newspaper Preservation Act&#8221; granting partial antitrust immunity to community newspapers, etc. Several of the speakers are surely going to rise to that bait with a loud Yes. (Believe it or not, meanwhile, the commission is asking if Congress should give journalism-related businesses even more antitrust immunity. Good grief.)</p>
<p>There&#8217;s only one subsidy that makes sense, only one that wouldn&#8217;t put government meddling squarely into the practice of journalism, an inevitable result of the direct subsidies being pushed by well-meaning but misguided media thinkers. It&#8217;s not on the agenda, however.</p>
<p>Taxpayer-assisted infrastructure &#8212; especially the postal system and low rates for sending publications &#8212; <a href="http://mediactive.com/2009/05/13/governments-long-history-of-supporting-journalism/">helped create the newspaper business</a>, and enabled a lot of other commerce. <a href="http://mediactive.com/2009/10/30/the-only-journalism-subsidy-we-need-is-in-bandwidth/">Bring forward</a> that logic to high-speed Internet access for all Americans, and enable the 21st Century communications infrastructure for all competitors.</p>
<p>As it is, we&#8217;re moving toward a market failure of frightening proportions, as the telecom industry clamps down, or threatens to, on people&#8217;s ability to use Internet connections as they see fit. We&#8217;re moving toward a media business consolidation that would terrify make any real champion of open markets: a cable-phone duopoly.</p>
<p>The Federal Communications Commission has jurisdiction over telecom, and is looking at the issue. But when it comes to how journalism will thrive in (not just survive) the Internet age, this should be high on any list of competitive issues of interest to agencies that push for competitive markets.</p>
<p>The word &#8220;broadband&#8221; is nowhere to be found in the FTC&#8217;s planning document. Coming from an agency that says it wants to promote competition, that speaks volumes.</p>
<p>UPDATE: Geoff Cowan and David Westphal write that <a href="http://www.ojr.org/ojr/people/davidwestphal/200911/1801/">governments support journalism</a> to the tune of more than $1 billion a year, and note one particularly targeted form: legal advertising that goes to dominant print organizations. (They also claim that it&#8217;s a common myth that there&#8217;s no government support for media, but they don&#8217;t cite anyone of prominence who&#8217;s saying that.) They are all in favor of continuing government assistance, more so that I am, but at least they strongly urge that it remain content-neutral, something that I strongly doubt could happen if direct subsidies ever happen.</p>
