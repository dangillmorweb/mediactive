		<p><img src="http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/kindle.png" border="0" alt="kindle.png" width="145" height="170" align="right" />A number of folks whom I admire greatly have <a href="http://www.defectivebydesign.org/amazon1984">signed a petition</a> aimed at Amazon&#8217;s control-freakish policies with its Kindle e-book reader. The most notable recent example of what&#8217;s wrong with the Kindle is the <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/32014285/ns/technology_and_science-tech_and_gadgets/">remote-deleting of books</a> that people had bought (with a refund).</p>
<p>The irony in Amazon&#8217;s action, since the deletions included George Orwell&#8217;s <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four">1984</a></em>, contributed to the mini-firestorm that erupted. In any case, Jeff Bezos, Amazon&#8217;s CEO, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/tag/kindle/forum/ref=cm_cd_ecf_tft_tp?_encoding=UTF8&amp;cdForum=Fx1D7SY3BVSESG&amp;cdThread=Tx1FXQPSF67X1IU">publicly apologized</a>. That was a smart and welcome move, but his letter to the Amazon community carefully <em>didn&#8217;t</em> promise not to do it again. This disappoints me as an author, Kindle owner and owner of a small amount of Amazon stock. (And I&#8217;m glad to see that a student is <a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/technology/2009/07/highlights-from-the-1984-lawsuit-against-amazon.html">standing up in court</a> against what happened to his own note-taking in the electronic edition.)</p>
<p>The petition to Amazon was organized by the good folks at the <a href="http://fsf.org">Free Software Foundation</a>, an organization I respect immensely. You can read it <a href="http://www.defectivebydesign.org/amazon1984">here</a>.</p>
<p>Although I agree with almost everything the petition says, I declined to sign. My reason was the use of the word &#8220;demand&#8221; &#8212; a word that, as I said to a foundation staff member, feels wrong in every way.</p>
<p>It strikes me as hollow to demand anything. Just as the incessant use of the word &#8220;must&#8221; in newspapers editorials &#8212; as in &#8220;President Obama must do this or that&#8221; &#8212; betrays editorial writers&#8217; fundamental impotence in such matters, demanding that people do this or that seems so unlikely to lead to action that it&#8217;s nearly pointless.</p>
<p>I prefer to urge, and try to persuade. So here&#8217;s the petition language (which I proposed but which was not adopted) that I&#8217;d have gladly signed:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Our way of life based on the free exchange of ideas, in which books have and will continue to hold a central role. Devices like the Kindle are setting the standard for how people interact with books, but the use of software to control, monitor, or eliminate users&#8217; books from afar constitutes a clear threat to the free exchange of ideas.</em></p>
<p><em>That is one reason why we &#8212; readers, authors, publishers and librarians &#8212; strongly urge that Amazon remove from the Kindle device the ability to control or access the books its users have purchased. </em></p>
<p><em>Amazon&#8217;s assurances that it won&#8217;t abuse this power are insufficient. Having this power is the problem. Until the company gives up this capability, the company will be tempted to use it &#8212; or may be forced to use it, by narrow private interests or by governments. Whatever Amazon&#8217;s motives for maintaining this control may be, they are not nearly as important as the public&#8217;s freedom to read books without interference or supervision.</em></p>
<p><em>Meanwhile, we are actively seeking alternatives to the Kindle. We will support &#8212; with our dollars, and the common sense that when we buy something we should own it &#8212; the companies that understand, and provide, true freedom of speech in the marketplace of ideas.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>In the end I think Amazon will come around on this, but I also believe  the people there will be unnecessarily put off by your petition, which  may make it counterproductive to all of our goals.</p>

<p>More about this <a href="http://recoveringjournalist.typepad.com/recovering_journalist/2009/07/introducing-growthspur.html">on Mark&#8217;s blog</a>.</p>
<p>Count me as one of Mark&#8217;s fans. He&#8217;s had his setbacks, including the ill-fated <a href="http://recoveringjournalist.typepad.com/recovering_journalist/2007/07/backfence-lesso.html">Backfence</a> project (when it failed, that was the end of my Grassroots Media Bayosphere project as well, as we&#8217;d sold it to Backfence). But he has kept working to help journalism stay alive and thrive in this new century, and for that he deserves kudos.</p>
<p>How well will this project work? We won&#8217;t know for a while. But Mark has lined up some excellent colleagues, and he knows a great deal about the topic at hand.</p>
<p>Most importantly, he and his team are among the thousands of people who are reinventing media and information &#8212; experimenting our way into a future that seems certain to be one of plenty, not scarcity. That&#8217;s the best news of all in his announcement.</p>

		<p><img src="http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Time-frugal-cover.png" "padding-top: 2px; padding-right: 4px;" alt="Time frugal cover.png" border="0" width="101" height="131" align="right" /> A fierce and fascinating debate has broken out over the <a href="http://www.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,20090427,00.html">cover photo</a> on Time magazine&#8217;s April 27 print edition. Time paid a pittance for the picture &#8212; at least a pittance next to what big magazines normally pay for cover art &#8212; and that&#8217;s made a lot of professional photographers furious.</p>
<p>They should get over it. But they and their gifted-amateur and part-timer peers &#8212; especially the ones capturing breaking news events &#8212; should start agitating for a better marketplace than the ones available today. More on that below, but first some background:</p>
<p>The marketplace for photography in an Internet era has changed irrevocably. In 2006 <a href="http://citmedia.org/blog/2006/12/04/the-demise-of-the-professional-photojournalist/">I argued</a> that the professional who will feel the pain most in the short run are the folks who shoot spot-news pictures. I said, in part:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>They can’t possibly compete in the media-sphere of the future. We’re entering a world of ubiquitous media creation and access. When the tools of creation and access are so profoundly democratized, and when updated business models connect the best creators with potential customers, many if not most of the pros will fight a losing battle to save their careers.<br />
</em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>This was bad news for them, I acknowledged, but not for the rest of us &#8212; because someone with a camera (probably part of a phone) almost always would be in a position to capture relevant still photos and/or, increasingly, videos of newsworthy events. We&#8217;d have <em>more</em> valuable pictures, not less, and production values would take second place to authenticity and timeliness.</p>
<p>I also said that staff feature photographers were in less trouble. The Time cover suggests I was premature in that assessement, though I do believe that great artists would always have a market for their work.</p>
<p>The rub, as anyone who spends any serious time on <a href="http://flickr.com">Flickr</a> already knows, is that amateur photographers are doing incredible work. Few of them can match the consistent quality of what the pros do, but they don&#8217;t have to. Every one of us is capable of capturing one supremely memorable image. Whatever you&#8217;re looking for, you can find it on Flickr or other photo sites including the <a href="http://www.istockphoto.com/index.php">stock-photos service</a> where <a href="http://www.modelmayhem.com/po.php?thread_id=480730">Robert Lam</a> listed the picture that ended up on Time&#8217;s cover, a photo for which he said he was paid $30, according to <a href="http://www.modelmayhem.com/po.php?thread_id=480730">this conversation thread</a> on the Model Mayhem photo community site, which includes some strenuous objections from pro photographers.</p>
<p>It does strike me as absurd that a huge magazine with huge circulation can get an image like Lam&#8217;s for so little money. But that was his choice, and it was Time&#8217;s choice to take advantage of low price he was asking.</p>
<p>Just as some people gladly take the New York Times&#8217; absurdly low pay when their freelance articles make it into the paper&#8217;s news and op-ed pages, some photographers gladly sell their work for peanuts to Time. They have their own reasons, which can range from getting valuable exposure &#8212; so they can (try to) charge more for subsequent work &#8212; to not needing the money staffers and more famous people can demand.</p>
<p>This gets trickier, it seems to me, when it comes to breaking news, where news organizations derive enormous benefits from having the right image or video at the right time and too frequently get it for less than peanuts. Indeed, practically every news organization now invites its audience to submit pictures and videos, in return for which the submitters typically get zip.</p>
<p>Which is why we need a more robust marketplace than any I&#8217;ve seen so far, namely a real-time auction system.</p>
<p>The sites currently promoting citizen journalists&#8217; work don&#8217;t offer anything of this sort, as far as I can tell. This isn&#8217;t to say I don&#8217;t like those sites, which include <a href="http://nowpublic.com">NowPublic</a> and <a href="http://demotix.com">Demotix</a>, because I like them a great deal. But someone needs to go further.</p>
<p>How would a real-time auction system work? The flow, I&#8217;d imagine, would go like this:</p>
<p>Photographer captures breaking news event on video or audio, and posts the work to the auction site. Potential buyers, especially media companies, get to see watermarked thumbnails and then start bidding. A time limit is enforced in each case. The winning bid goes to the journalist, minus a cut to the auction service.</p>
<p>The premium, then, would be on timeliness and authenticity. One or two images/videos would be likely to command relatively high prices, and everything else would be worth considerably less.</p>
<p>Eventually, someone will do this kind of business &#8212; which could also be useful for eyewitness text accounts of events. For the sake of the citizen journalists who are not getting what they deserve for their work, I hope it&#8217;s sooner than later.</p>

After taking a look at it, he concluded that, yes, it <a href="http://freedom-to-tinker.com/blog/felten/aps-drm-announcement-much-ado-about-nothing">makes no sense</a> whatever and isn&#8217;t worth the fretting that&#8217;s emanating from some quarters. Key quotes:</p>
<p><em><br />
<blockquote>As far as I can tell, the underlying technology is based on hNews, a microformat for news, shown in the AP diagram, that was announced by AP and the Media Standards Trust two weeks before the recent AP announcement.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for AP, the hNews spec bears little resemblance to AP&#8217;s claims about it. hNews is a handy way of annotating news stories with information about the author, dateline, and so on. But it doesn&#8217;t &#8220;encapsulate&#8221; anything in a &#8220;wrapper&#8221;, nor does it do much of anything to facilitate metering, monitoring, or paywalls.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>It seems that there is much less to the AP&#8217;s announcement than meets the eye. If there&#8217;s a story here, it&#8217;s in the mismatch between the modest and reasonable underlying technology, and AP&#8217;s grandiose claims for it.
</p></blockquote>
<p></em></p>
<p>The AP and its newspaper owners are starting to remind us the music industry and its attack-dog RIAA. That&#8217;s sad, in the extreme.</p>

		<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-363" title="politico" src="http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/politico.png" alt="politico" width="169" height="40" />Salon&#8217;s Glenn Greenwald <a href="http://www.salon.com/opinion/greenwald/2009/07/29/politico/">takes a long look</a> today at a phenomenon that he and a few other bloggers have repeatedly observed. Namely, the online politics site Politico has a distinctly right-wing world view.</p>
<p>This is a simple fact, just as Fox News&#8217; right-wing slant is plain as day, even though these news organizations don&#8217;t come out and admit the reality.</p>
<p>And the Politico editors&#8217; disinclination to acknowledge the way they see &#8212; and report &#8212; the news has a secondary effect. They have accomplices in the traditional press. I&#8217;ve been looking for some hint in big newspapers (forget broadcast news in this respect) that Politico&#8217;s reports frequently have a Republican viewpoint, but haven&#8217;t found one so far.</p>
<p>Now, I have no problem with news organizations having a world view, and I do read Politico, which for all its superficiality sometimes has truly deep reporting. The problem is that most traditional ones pretend they don&#8217;t. I&#8217;m glad sites like Politico exist, but disappointed that they don&#8217;t make overtly clear the prism through which they see things.</p>
<p>Transparency would help. In the absence of that, deploy your own skepticism. That&#8217;s what Greenwald does, so relentlessly, and so should we all.</p>

<p>Others have been more eloquent, of course. But allow me to join those who mourn the death of this great journalist.</p>
<p>I grew up in an era when Walter Cronkite told us that&#8217;s the way it was. It usually was, and he and his CBS News team earned a nation&#8217;s trust.</p>
<p>Many people think of the Kennedy assassination when they remember Cronkite &#8212; his moment of visible pain after <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K8Q3cqGs7I&#038;feature=player_embedded">announcing the president&#8217;s death</a>. It was, indeed, one of those moments that stays forever in one&#8217;s mind and heart.</p>
<p>I prefer to think of him from the day that brought the greatest joy to an American generation: the first moon landing in 1969. Like so many others, I was watching CBS. The landing was a closer call than most of us knew at the time. Clearly, in retrospect, Cronkite understood how close the lander came to running out of fuel. The <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_sWmD6NvMY&#038;feature=player_embedded">relief and happiness</a> on his face in the above video after the Eagle settled onto the moon&#8217;s surface was a great moment, brought to the world by a great journalist. (Note: I&#8217;ve chosen the clip above for another reason, as well: Cronkite was reporting a story, and the focus was where it belonged, on the astronauts and the team that put them on the moon. The reporter wasn&#8217;t the story, and he made sure we all knew that.)</p>
<p>Walter Cronkite was, as we all are, partly a product of his own times. There won&#8217;t be &#8212; there can&#8217;t be in a media ecosystem like the one we&#8217;re creating &#8212; another like him.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>It&#8217;s now widely known that hackers got ahold of some extremely private communications held by Twitter&#8217;s co-founder, and then leaked them to several blogs including TechCrunch. For a <em>legal</em> analysis check out  <a href="http://www.citmedialaw.org/blog/2009/first-amendment-protects-techcrunchs-publication-some-hacked-twitter-documents">Sam Bayard&#8217;s post</a> at the Harvard Berkman Center&#8217;s Citizen Media Law Project.</p>
<p>A number of folks have asked me what I think of the situation. Here&#8217;s part of what I said on a mail list yesterday:</p>
<blockquote><p>As always, the circumstances matter; I&#8217;d never make a blanket condemnation of such acts. The New York Times&#8217; reporting of secret &#8212; and illegal &#8212; spying by our government on Americans strikes me as exactly what we want, and need, from journalists. </p>
<p>This particular episode, however, makes me want to take a shower. I wouldn&#8217;t have published the material, but that&#8217;s just my personal stance. As the saying goes, what the public is interested in may not be in the public interest. </p>
<p>TechCrunch&#8217;s Mike Arrington is almost certainly within his rights to post at least some of this material &#8212; though no way would his lawyers let him post it all, if it contains everything he&#8217;s said it contains &#8212; even if what he&#8217;s doing is, IMO, supremely cynical. Especially puke-worthy is Arrington&#8217;s public agonizing about whether (and what) to post. It strikes me, whether he intends it or not, as linkbait designed to pull lots and lots and lots of traffic.</p>
<p>What boggles me almost more than anything about this, by the way, is the shabby security at Google and Twitter.
</p></blockquote>
<p>One of the most important outcomes of this event, if we learn the right lessons, will be to improve our security practices when it comes to personal and company information. The systems we now use for password recovery are absurdly open to social hacking, and that&#8217;s apparently what got the Twitter folks in trouble.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, I wonder how careful the TechCrunch team has been about its own passwords and other security&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The Obama administration has turned its &#8220;online town hall&#8221; events into a parody of what they were intended to be, which specifically were supposed to include a genuine effort to include questions from the citizens of this nation in an open process, not the bogus pre-selection system that is turning into an Obama trademark. Yesterday&#8217;s <a href="http://wwzDQ&amp;feature=player_embedded" target="_top">health care event</a>, for example, included just three questions from online contributors (and only eight in all, <a href="http://techpresident.com/blog-entry/obama-delivers-health-care-pitch-sprinkle-people-and-dash-digital" target="_top">notes the TechPresident blog</a>) in an event that makes some of George W. Bush&#8217;s staged events seem almost spontaneous.</p>
<p>When called on this by White House journalists, Obama press secretary Robert Gibbs responded with arrogance. He demonstrated not just contempt for the Washington press corps (which does often earn contempt) but also to the administration&#8217;s promises of openness and bottom-up accountability. A shabby performance, and worrisome if you care about how this White House will behave when its current public favor diminishes, as it surely will.</p>
<p><object width="445" height="364"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/v/fh5vzOAEQ-A&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0&amp;border=1" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><embed src="http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/v/fh5vzOAEQ-A&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0&amp;border=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="445" height="364" /></object><br />
So when you watch one of these events in the future, be aware that there&#8217;s barely a shred of the give-and-take we were promised. This White House would rather rely, at least for now, on the kind of staging that previous presidents used so often, and which candidate Obama and many of his aides and supporters found so correctly offensive.</p>
