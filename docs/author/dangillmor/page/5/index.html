	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><em>The Economist asked me (part of its &#8220;future of news&#8221; series) what I thought the impact of the News Corp. voicemail hacking case would be. The link goes to my reply, which I&#8217;m cross-posting it here (and on Google+):<br /></em></p>
<div>It is clear that the Murdochs’ appearance before the parliamentary committee did not begin to save them from further trouble. How far and high the scandal will go remains to be seen. For the news business, the impact could in the end be useful—provided, of course, that governments do not use this scandal as an excuse to clamp down on the proper role of the press.</p>
<p>The case could be useful for several reasons: first, it might lead tabloid journalists to behave a little bit more like human beings and a little bit less like jackals. Tabloid journalism can be excellent, when it is focused on genuine wrongdoing by the rich and powerful. The private lives of these people are rarely relevant, but actions that affect people outside their families and social circles are entirely relevant.</p>
<p>Second, it might prompt all journalists to do a bit of soul-searching about the bargains we make with our sources. Reporters at the best organisations may not pay the police, but they have tacit arrangements, including the reality that few journalists will probe as hard at the motives or actions of their best sources as they do at the targets of their stories. Careers are enhanced by favourable coverage; this may not be payoff (and it may not even strike the journalist as a payment of any sort) but there is a connection.</p>
<p>Third, and most important (if least likely), it might lead the consumers of the tabloid press—this particularly applies to television and talk radio as well as newspapers and magazines—to consider their own role in the sleaze that so often passes for journalism. So many people now say they are appalled by the tabloid press and the doings in London, yet they still click on stories that give details of the latest celebrity scandal or news about the warped among us. These consumers of sleaze are the reason the Murdochs and their fellow bottom-feeders do what they do, and why they&#8217;ve found it so profitable. I hope they’ll at least make that connection in the future.</p>
<p>We should all worry, however, that governments will seize on this particular case to further restrict journalists’ ability to do their work. On both sides of the Atlantic, as well as in much of the world, the wealthy and powerful and their patrons in government would like nothing better than to curb the press.</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal editorial page, among other Murdoch-controlled properties, has fretted loudly about the attacks on News Corporation since the scandal broke open. They claim the fierce criticism of their company threatens the freedom of the press itself. In fact, if this case does lead to further press restrictions that inhibit robust journalism, it will have been Murdoch and his cronies who caused the damage. That would be a shameful legacy.</p></div></p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>In the days ahead &#8212; and especially after New York prosecutors drop their <a href="http://news.google.com/news/story?pz=1&amp;cf=all&amp;ned=us&amp;hl=en&amp;q=dsk&amp;ncl=d8sKqL-EkF6iuYM2wq0SkwDP44czM&amp;ict=ln">increasingly pathetic case</a> against former IMF head Dominique Strauss-Kahn, as they surely will &#8212; you&#8217;ll see some media coverage of journalism&#8217;s role in this debacle. There will be a few notes about how everyone rushed to judgment.</p>
<p>But almost no one will be asking more basic questions about the way journalists go about their business in criminal cases. You will see little or no self-reflection about the way reporters work in concert with law enforcement in almost all such cases, in ways that are designed by the police and prosecutors to stack the deck against the accused.</p>
<p>It starts with the &#8220;perp walk&#8221; &#8212; the parading of the accused before cameras. Try this thought experiment. Imagine you&#8217;ve been arrested, and have spent a night in a filthy jail cell, getting maybe an hour of sleep in the clothes you were wearing the day before. Or, perhaps, you&#8217;ve been told to put on an orange jump suit that prisoners wear. Either way, now you&#8217;re shackled and frog-walked into a van that takes you to the courthouse. Then you&#8217;re manhandled out of the van and are frog-walked through a gauntlet of cameras and shouting reporters.</p>
<p>How do you imagine you&#8217;d look, whether or not you were innocent? You&#8217;d look guilty as hell, because the perp walk is <em>designed</em> to make you look guilty. (For more on perp walks, see <a href="http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/als-morning-meeting/132692/is-it-ethical-to-use-perp-walk-images-of-dominique-strauss-kahn-imf-chief-accused-of-attempted-rape/">this piece</a> from the Poynter Institute&#8217;s Al Tompkins.)</p>
<p>The deck-stacking extends to the charges themselves. Charges are only accusations; they are not proof. Yet they are repeated verbatim by reporters in ways that make them sound like &#8220;this is what happened,&#8221; and putting &#8220;alleged&#8221; into the story doesn&#8217;t change that perception.</p>
<p>Then comes the tendency journalists to get on-the-record (can be published) material from people who refuse to attach their names to what they&#8217;re saying, often from law enforcement sources who are, again, working hard to ensure that any potential juror will assume guilt. I <a href="http://www.iwatchnews.org/node/4702">mentioned</a> an example of this several weeks ago: a reprehensible story describing <em>supposed</em> details about what the <em>alleged</em> victim in the Strauss-Kahn case had told police and co-workers.</p>
<p>Look. I don&#8217;t know what happened in that hotel suite. Only two people know. One of them has an <em>alleged</em> record in France of being promiscuous and pushy with women (stories I tend to believe, in part because some of the women have gone public). The other, we have learned, has lied repeatedly to police and prosecutors, according to on-the-record statements from law enforcement people &#8212; though even now the anonymous sources continue to have a field day in supposedly responsible media outlets.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s blatantly obvious, based on what is known for sure, is that the woman is not a credible witness. Period. It is certainly possible that she was sexually assaulted in that suite. But &#8220;possible&#8221; is light-years away from the level of proof needed to send another person to jail for what would likely be the rest of his life.</p>
<p>What seems to have escaped most of the journalists covering this case, from the very beginning, is the same thing that the media ignore in almost all criminal cases: an actual presumption of innocence. If we believed in the presumption of innocence, we wouldn&#8217;t collaborate with the prosecutors and police on perp walks. We wouldn&#8217;t let ourselves be used to seed a presumption of guilt into the jury pool.</p>
<p>The defense you&#8217;ll hear is simple, and sounds compelling: The fact is that the most of the people arrested and prosecuted are in fact guilty. Law enforcement almost always operates in good faith, to get the bad guys.</p>
<p>But there are well-documented cases of bad faith. And even the best police and prosecutors make mistakes. That&#8217;s why a presumption of innocence is so essential &#8212; and why it&#8217;s shameful that journalists persist in mocking it.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>In the New York pages of today&#8217;s New York Times you&#8217;ll find a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/12/nyregion/cyclists-embrace-a-handless-cuban-who-wants-to-race.html">terrific story</a> about a Cuban bicyclist named Damian Lopez Alfonso, who hasn&#8217;t let his handicaps (no arms) stop him from becoming a competitive racer. As the Times style requires, the story refers to him as Mr. Alfonso.</p>
<p>Had this story appeared in another logical location &#8212; the sports pages &#8212; the &#8220;Mr.&#8221; would have been removed. This is also a requirement of the Times&#8217; style guide.</p>
<p>The Times mandates courtesy titles (Mr., Ms., etc.) only in news stories, though it drops them for some dead people and those it arbitrarily considers evil enough not to deserve them. For example, Osama Bin Laden lost his Mr. after US forces killed him in May. But Saddam Hussein was recently still being called Mr. Hussein, as <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2292781/">Slate notes</a>.</p>
<p>Entertainers get honorifics in the Times, so you&#8217;ll read stories about the Rolling Stones you&#8217;ll see references to Mr. Jagger and Mr. Richards. (The Times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/21/arts/review-rock-almost-on-broadway-meat-loaf-puts-on-a-show.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm">reviewer of this Meat Loaf concert</a> apparently couldn&#8217;t bring himself to writing the laugh-out-loud &#8220;Mr. Loaf,&#8221; and just used &#8220;Meat Loaf&#8221; throughout.)</p>
<p>Athletes &#8212; at least those deemed newsworthy by the Times &#8212; are entertainers, too. The make lots of money. They take lots of drugs. They get arrested. Oh, they perform. But no honorifics for them.</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal used to be consistent. But in a recent move that was semi-lampooned even by its own columnist, it opted to drop the honorifics <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704476604576158543603040876.html">for stories in the sports section</a>. The logic for the move? None, apart from the notion that it somehow sounded better, or at least less ridiculous, to just go with last names.</p>
<p>These policies aren&#8217;t just inconsistent. They&#8217;re incoherent.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re also a quaint vestige of a dying era, when the New York Times, Wall Street Journal and the vanishingly small number of other papers that do this actually believed they were showing respect for the people they covered. (Except for supremely evil people and athletes, who obviously deserve none.) Did the papers self-enforced civility (except for athletes and people deemed supremely evil) may actually have had an impact on the journalists&#8217; work, or on the perception of the newspapers that had this policy?</p>
<p>But respect is in short enough supply in our society. There&#8217;s nothing wrong with honorifics, if they&#8217;re used consistently. The incoherent policies at the Times and Journal don&#8217;t demonstrate respect for the people they cover when they deliberately omit courtesy titles for a single class of people in specific pages; rather, they demonstrate disrespect.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>So many things are disappointing about the FCC&#8217;s just-released <a href="http://reboot.fcc.gov/futureofmedia">future of media</a> report that it&#8217;s tempting to write it off entirely. That would be a mistake.</p>
<p>Shallowness in research isn&#8217;t one of the problems. No one can accuse the <a href="http://transition.fcc.gov/osp/inc-report/INoC-Acknowledgments.pdf">working group</a> (PDF), headed by Steve Waldman and 18 months in the making, of not doing some serious homework, with interviews, hearings and data collection.</p>
<p>A few traditional news organizations were favored with embargoed copies of the report ahead of time (Exhibit A of the problem), though after reading their articles I&#8217;m not sure if they did much more than skim it. In any event, my quick comments here &#8212; I hope to do more later on &#8212; are based on a fast read-through of the report, which bizarrely appears to be available on the FCC website only as a collection of PDFs, with no HTML version (Exhibit B). Happily, lots of folks, including Josh Stearns from the media reform organization <a href="http://freepress.org">Free Press</a>, have posted it as an embeddable a <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/57454752/FCC-Report-THE-INFORMATION-NEEDS-OF-COMMUNITIES">Scribd document</a>.</p>
<p>My initial reaction, as suggested at the top, is puzzlement at the working group&#8217;s missed opportunities.</p>
<p>The report&#8217;s main takeaway, from what I can see, is that local news is declining. That&#8217;s true, in part. No one can dispute the massive disinvestment in journalism by local newspapers and broadcasters in recent years. The rise of hyperlocal news has helped fill some gaps, but there&#8217;s no question that fewer paid journalists &#8212; at least ones working for organizations that try to provide news to the general public &#8212; are paying attention to local and state governments than before.</p>
<p>The report largely stays away from what many observers, including me, had feared. It does <em>not</em> ask for major government intervention in news. Whew. At the hearing where I spoke, more than a few people wanted just that kind of recommendation.</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s a caveat: It suggests steering what could ultimately be more than $1 billion in annual federal advertising spending (for such things as military recruitment) away from big media organizations to smaller, local ones. The can of worms this will open is fairly large, not least the political favoritism that is certain to pick winners in such a process. I guarantee, if this goes anywhere, that the dollars will flow to the companies that have the most clout on K Street, not the new media organizations that are doing the hardest work now to fill the gaps.</p>
<p>The report&#8217;s subtitle, &#8220;The changing media landscape in a broadband age,&#8221; highlights my biggest disappointment &#8212; its lack of serious recommendations regarding the real and growing broadband problem in the U.S. The authors insist that &#8220;Universal broadband and an open Internet are essential prerequisites for ensuring that the new media landscape serves communities well,&#8221; but their recommendations are utterly vague on how we can get there.</p>
<p>In Mediactive, I wrote that only one major government intervention makes sense:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="margin-top: 1em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">only one that wouldn’t put government meddling squarely into the practice of journalism—an inevitable result of the direct subsidies being pushed by well-meaning but misguided media thinkers. It’s a subsidy for bandwidth: getting true broadband Internet access to as many people as possible, as some other nations in Europe and Asia have done.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 1em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">The precedent in this case is the right one. Taxpayer-assisted infrastructure—especially the postal system and low rates for sending publications—helped create the newspaper business, and enabled a lot of other commerce. Let’s bring that logic forward to the early 21st century, and enable high-speed Internet access for all Americans, and a communications infrastructure for all competitors.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m not surprised that this idea went nowhere, just disappointed.</p>
<p>From what I can tell, the report gives short shrift to network neutrality, or rules guaranteeing users&#8217; rights to select the media they want, not the media to which the broadband providers and their commercial partners want to give priority. The suggestion that new wireless services will solve the problem by adding competition is at best wishful thinking.</p>
<p>Maybe the working group is just recognizing reality. America&#8217;s leaders have made it clear that they do not consider it a taxpayer issue to ensure broadband access; they&#8217;ve stood by while the U.S. slides dramatically in world rankings of the most-connected nations. And they&#8217;ve increasingly shown hostility to the vital need for rules to ensure that average citizens, not corporate America, can make their own decisions. The journalism ecosystem of the future utterly depends on connectivity and net neutrality. Paying lip service to these notions doesn&#8217;t help.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>You don&#8217;t have to be a supporter of Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the former International Monetary Fund chief who&#8217;s been charged with sex crimes in New York City, to be appalled at some of the journalism about this case. Sadly, you can find a prime example on the website of the normally high-minded Center for Public Integrity, <a href="http://www.iwatchnews.org/node/4702">a totally damning piece</a> by John Solomon based on lurid new allegations from two unnamed sources &#8220;familiar with the investigation.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sources insisted on anonymity, Solomon reports, &#8220;because of the ongoing investigation&#8230;.&#8221; What in the world does that mean? Nothing: It&#8217;s an empty non-excuse for refusing to stand behind their own words.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s my take. These sources are almost certainly in law enforcement. I believe they are almost certainly trying to solidify the public perception of Strauss-Kahn as a criminal scumbag, and do this so thoroughly that almost anyone serving on any jury will come into the trial with a predisposition to find him guilty &#8212; and that his defense lawyers, knowing that this is the case, will go with a plea bargain.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t doubt that Solomon has reported faithfully what he was told. That doesn&#8217;t make any of it true. Nor do I doubt that Solomon and his editors trust these sources. There&#8217;s no reason why you should, since they won&#8217;t stand behind their own words.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m no fan of Strauss-Kahn, nor of the French media&#8217;s habit of glossing over ugly behavior among the people &#8212; almost all men &#8212; who rule government and business. He may well have done this crime. But I&#8217;m sticking with innocent until proved guilty.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been a longtime fan of, and have contributed to, the Center for Public Integrity. That won&#8217;t change. But as I&#8217;ve said privately to a friend in the organization, I believe this piece was way below the center&#8217;s standards.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m writing an occasional online column for the Guardian, one of the great English-language media organizations. The latest piece, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/may/18/digital-media-social-media">&#8220;The Web&#8217;s Weakest Links,&#8221;</a> implores creators of online content to link to original material, not the rewrites that have become so common by so-called &#8220;aggregators&#8221; that (in my view) do a disservice to everyone but themselves. Quoting myself (very briefly):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So, the next time you link to something, check it out a bit more. If it&#8217;s just a summary of someone else&#8217;s original reporting or analysis, take the extra few seconds to link to the original.

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I&#8217;ve just signed a site license with a journalism school for the e-book. We worked out a sliding scale of payments. The university will pay a discounted rate from the list price for the first 40 copies. For each copy beyond that, up to 250, the rate will be lower yet. And after 250, the license will be free for anyone else at the university who wants to download the book.</p>
<p>This is a good deal for both sides. The school gets a deeply discounted book. I get some cash. If more schools sign up for this kind of thing, I could end up making a non-trivial amount of money.</p>
<p>Why should the schools pay? Because they are engaged in a business arrangement in which they sell courses to students and assign this book as part of that arrangement. The Creative Commons license I&#8217;ve used to publish <em>Mediactive</em> allows copying at will for non-commercial purposes, but universities using the book in classroom settings are, in fact, engaged in a commercial activity even if the universities are not-for-profit entities themselves.</p>
<p>My agent, <a href="http://garamondagency.com/">David Miller</a>, says he&#8217;s heard of major publishers doing site licenses for books. He hasn&#8217;t heard of self-published authors doing it this way. That doesn&#8217;t mean it hasn&#8217;t happened, of course &#8212; but it&#8217;s definitely new to me! (I continue to learn new things about the publishing business with this project, which is one reason I&#8217;m doing it this way&#8230;)</p>
<p>If you are teaching journalism (or anything else) and are interested in using this book, please get in touch to discuss a site license. They book isn&#8217;t expensive even at its list price, but there are even better deals for bulk orders, especially e-book bulk orders.</p>
<p>By the way, I&#8217;m working with several colleagues on lesson plans for <em>Mediactive</em>. They&#8217;re coming along nicely and will be available, if all goes well, by mid-summer or so. We have a few nifty ideas in mind for this part of the project, so stay tuned.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>In 2005, intending to innovate, the Los Angeles Times published a &#8220;Wikitorial&#8221; &#8212; an editorial from the paper in a wiki that allowed readers to make changes. The idea was interesting. The execution was a classic in news organization stupidity, because after putting up the piece the news people went home for the night. Naturally, some bad folks took over, and early the next morning they&#8217;d thoroughly polluted the thing. One image that found its way onto the wikitorial was an infamously disgusting photograph. <a href="http://www.latimes.com/la-wiki-splash,0,3350970.htmlstory">Down came the page</a>, and that was that.</p>
<p>The LA Times learned the wrong lesson. Rather than giving up the experiment, it should have tried again.</p>
<p>The failed LA project comes to mind in the wake of the Wall Street Journal&#8217;s launch of a WikiLeaks-like experiment, a site called <a href="https://www.wsjsafehouse.com/">SafeHouse</a>. The page pitches these bullet points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Help The Wall Street Journal uncover fraud, abuse and other wrongdoing.</li>
<li>Send documents to us using a special system built to be secure.</li>
<li>Keep your identity anonymous or confidential, if needed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Uh, not really, at least on the second and third points.</p>
<p>Security experts <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CCMQqQIwAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fblogs.forbes.com%2Fandygreenberg%2F2011%2F05%2F05%2Fresearchers-say-wsjs-wikileaks-copycat-is-full-of-holes%2F&amp;ei=dzLETerPHYW-sAPmuYGfAQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNE9wz9keoVWWHm4RyKLqLiM_ZId1A&amp;sig2=lw_S6CdC6nf7Dlm_f_pTMg">immediately poked holes</a> in the site security. And the site&#8217;s <a href="https://www.wsjsafehouse.com/terms.html">Terms of Service</a> contain what might be termed a &#8220;Get Into Jail Free Card&#8221; &#8212; reserving &#8220;the right to disclose any information about you to law enforcement authorities or to a requesting third party, without notice, in order to comply with any applicable laws and/or requests under legal process, to operate our systems properly, to protect the property or rights of Dow Jones or any affiliated companies, and to safeguard the interests of others.&#8221;</p>
<p>Unlike the LA Times, the Journal isn&#8217;t abandoning the experiment and seems to be working to <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/JoshHalliday/status/66526655262375936">fix at least some</a> of the site&#8217;s flaws. That&#8217;s good news, even though I&#8217;d still advise any whistleblower to steer clear of this for the moment, not least because the notion of trusting a company controlled by Rupert Murdoch is, well, problematic even if one might trust (as I would) many of the Journal&#8217;s lower-level editors.</p>
<p>Which raises the larger question in any case: While I tend to believe that every news organization should have a drop-off point for documents from whistleblowers, there&#8217;s always going to be a question of how much a leaker should trust any private company on which a government can exert pressure, apart the issue of whether the company itself can always be trusted. Remember, the New York Times has frequently felt obliged to ask permission from the U.S. government before publishing a variety of things.</p>
<p>Still, these experiments are worthwhile. But it&#8217;s going to take some time before we can call them successes in any respect.</p>
