We agreed: Given Jobs&#8217; personality, the world would not be better off.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 1em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 13px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; font: normal normal normal 1.3em/1.5em georgia, serif; clear: both; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">A few days ago, when Apple&#8217;s market capitalization &#8212; the value of all its shares &#8212; <a style="border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-left-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 13px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; color: #cc0000; text-decoration: none; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: #cccccc; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/27/technology/27apple.html" target="_blank">surpassed Microsoft&#8217;s</a>, I thought back to that years-ago conversation with a mix of amazement and angst. While Apple isn&#8217;t likely to have the same level of domination that Microsoft achieved, Jobs and company are clearly aiming high. Their strategy for the next generation of personal technology is to control the ecosystem at every level, and to rake off a piece of all the financial transactions taking place there.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 1em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 13px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; font: normal normal normal 1.3em/1.5em georgia, serif; clear: both; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">And Tuesday night, at the Wall Street Journal&#8217;s <a style="border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-left-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 13px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; color: #cc0000; text-decoration: none; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: #cccccc; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;" href="http://allthingsd.com/" target="_blank">All Things Digital</a> conference, Steve Jobs generated his trademark <a style="border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-left-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 13px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; color: #cc0000; text-decoration: none; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: #cccccc; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;" href="http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?project=Macintosh&amp;story=Reality_Distortion_Field.txt&amp;topic=Reality%20Distortion&amp;sortOrder=Sort%20by%20Date&amp;detail=medium" target="_blank">&#8220;reality distortion field,&#8221;</a>demonstrating again one of the reasons he&#8217;s the premier CEO of recent times. More than any other company I can name, Apple reflects its CEO&#8217;s values and style &#8212; a breathtaking combination of arrogance and genius.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 1em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 13px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; font: normal normal normal 1.3em/1.5em georgia, serif; clear: both; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">Jobs told the audience of tech, media and financial big shots that his values and goals haven&#8217;t changed at all in the past few years. The top of those, he said, was to make great products that people will pay for because they recognize the value. As <a style="border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-left-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 13px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; color: #cc0000; text-decoration: none; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: #cccccc; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;" href="http://searls.com/" target="_blank">Doc Searls</a>, currently a fellow at Harvard&#8217;s Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society, <a style="border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-left-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 13px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; color: #cc0000; text-decoration: none; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: #cccccc; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;" href="http://www.scripting.com/davenet/stories/DocSearlsonSteveJobs.html" target="_blank">explained so well</a> back in 1997, not long after Jobs returned to Apple after more than a decade in exile from the company he co-founded, &#8220;Steve is an elitist and an innovator, and damn good at both. His greatest achievements are novel works of beauty and style.&#8221;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 1em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 13px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; font: normal normal normal 1.3em/1.5em georgia, serif; clear: both; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">Apple products are among the finest examples of industrial design you&#8217;ll find in the technology world. They combine power and ease of use. I&#8217;ve been a happy Mac customer for many years.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 1em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 13px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; font: normal normal normal 1.3em/1.5em georgia, serif; clear: both; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">With the Mac, as with Windows computers (and Linux, etc.), software developers can write programs using a variety of development tools. Then the developers can sell their programs to computer users, who find the software in a variety of marketplaces, increasingly online.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 1em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 13px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; font: normal normal normal 1.3em/1.5em georgia, serif; clear: both; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">The Mac in Jobs&#8217; regimes was a single-sourced machine; no clones allowed. This turned out to be a wise move, but Apple has taken the control to new heights.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 1em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 13px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; font: normal normal normal 1.3em/1.5em georgia, serif; clear: both; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">Starting with the iPhone and iPod Touch series of products and continuing with the new iPad, Apple has officially permitted users to install software on the devices they&#8217;ve purchased only if they obtain the software through Apple&#8217;s online store. Apple requires developers to go through an approval process that is widely considered opaque and capricious &#8212; this developer&#8217;s blog post on Tuesday, titled <a style="border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-left-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 13px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; color: #cc0000; text-decoration: none; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: #cccccc; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;" href="http://shiftyjelly.wordpress.com/2010/06/01/sentence-first-verdict-afterwards/" target="_blank">&#8220;Sentence first &#8212; verdict afterwards,&#8221;</a> gives you a flavor of what can happen. And Apple takes a cut of the sales price of the applications.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 1em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 13px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; font: normal normal normal 1.3em/1.5em georgia, serif; clear: both; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">Jobs told the All Things Digital audience a different story. Even as he acknowledged flaws in the marketplace, he suggested that the 5 percent of application developers who don&#8217;t get approved in the first week are either cheaters or porn peddlers. What he resolutely didn&#8217;t acknowledge was that the closed market might itself be the problem; indeed, he insisted that his &#8220;curated&#8221; store is the nearest thing to Nirvana that we&#8217;ve seen to date in the software world.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 1em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 13px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; font: normal normal normal 1.3em/1.5em georgia, serif; clear: both; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">The control has gotten sterner. Apple now requires developers to use<em>only</em> the tools Apple provides to create software; this has the effect of forcing developers to duplicate their time and efforts if they want to write apps for other platforms. Apple refuses to let anyone provide iPhone OS apps that use a variety of forbidden technologies including, most famously, Adobe&#8217;s Flash software for viewing animations and videos. When the upcoming in-app advertising system is running, it will likely also impose restrictions on what developers and content owners can do.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 1em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 13px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; font: normal normal normal 1.3em/1.5em georgia, serif; clear: both; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">Now, Apple&#8217;s control hasn&#8217;t stopped thousands of developers from creating several hundred thousand apps. Even though many are obvious knockoffs of each other, as is the case in any OS environment, no one can suggest that there&#8217;s not a great deal of innovation going on in the iPhone OS world &#8212; in part because Apple, better than any other company, gets the foundation combining hardware and software so right.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 1em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 13px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; font: normal normal normal 1.3em/1.5em georgia, serif; clear: both; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">But Apple&#8217;s restrictions have plainly kept some terrific work, or at least apps that are useful but annoy Apple for some reason, from appearing. A &#8220;<a style="border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-left-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 13px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; color: #cc0000; text-decoration: none; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: #cccccc; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jailbreaking_for_iPhone_OS" target="_blank">jailbreak&#8221; community</a> of people who have hacked their iPhones testifies to this.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 1em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 13px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; font: normal normal normal 1.3em/1.5em georgia, serif; clear: both; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">The control-freakery extends to the content, as we&#8217;ve seen again and again. Apple&#8217;s idea of acceptable content is roughly what you&#8217;ll find at Disneyland. The company reserves the right to bar or later remove apps that contain information for any reason it chooses. This is how the brilliant Mark Fiore found his iPhone cartoon app disallowed due to its political content &#8212; until he won a Pulitzer Prize in April, at which point Apple decided to allow it. (Jobs says the rules changed after Fiore&#8217;s original rejection, by which time Apple realized it was making a mistake with political content, but the cartoonist didn&#8217;t realize this.)</p>

What does it say about their journalistic principles that they&#8217;d do this? Most won&#8217;t even respond to the question, and I&#8217;ve asked many. National Public Radio&#8217;s Kinsey Wilson, who heads up NPR&#8217;s online development, is one of the few to admit discomfort with the situation, saying that Apple <a style="border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-left-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 13px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; color: #cc0000; text-decoration: none; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: #cccccc; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;" href="http://mediactive.com/2010/04/23/washington-post-and-npr-yes-apple-can-block-their-ipad-journalism/" target="_blank">holds the leverage</a> at this point; he, and other news executives, are basically hoping Apple won&#8217;t jerk them around the way it&#8217;s done with others.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 1em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 13px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; font: normal normal normal 1.3em/1.5em georgia, serif; clear: both; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">Steve Jobs&#8217; explanation for all of this is downright Orwellian. Consider his recent <a style="border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-left-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 13px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; color: #cc0000; text-decoration: none; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: #cccccc; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;" href="http://gawker.com/5539717/steve-jobs-offers-world-freedom-from-porn?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+valleywag%2Ffull+%28Valleywag%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader" target="_blank">late-night e-mail exchange</a> with Gawker&#8217;s Ryan Tate. It started this way:</p>
<p style="margin-top: 1em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 13px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; font: normal normal normal 1.3em/1.5em georgia, serif; clear: both; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;"><img style="outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 13px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; max-width: 445px; display: block; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;" src="http://www.salon.com/technology/dan_gillmor/2010/06/02/steve_jobs_walled_garden/jobs_tate.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="445" height="242" /></p>
<p style="margin-top: 1em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 13px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; font: normal normal normal 1.3em/1.5em georgia, serif; clear: both; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">You should realize that Jobs&#8217; view of porn &#8212; like his company&#8217;s view of forbidden political content (the latter policy has been amended in a more liberal way, Jobs said) &#8212; essentially means anything more adult than what in the movie business would get a PG rating. (Unless, of course, the Apple content police decide that, say, the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue, reportedly as racy as some banned apps, should be allowed, which it is.)</p>
<p style="margin-top: 1em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 13px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; font: normal normal normal 1.3em/1.5em georgia, serif; clear: both; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">Jobs will provide us a Disney-like, PG-rated walled garden &#8212; where he gets a cut of <em>all</em> of the action &#8212; ostensibly to protect us from a variety of things that we may or may not want to be protected from, all in the name of freedom. Truly, Orwell could not have said it better. (And Dylan, if he saw how his anthem had been abused this way, must surely have been amazed.)</p>
<p style="margin-top: 1em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 13px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; font: normal normal normal 1.3em/1.5em georgia, serif; clear: both; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">Of course, as many others have noted, Jobs&#8217; alleged freedom from porn is a joke, given that the iPhone and iPad have Web browsers that can quite easily be used to see plenty of X-rated material. Will Jobs ratchet down the part of his ecosystem he now insists will remain open? If not, why not, given his notion that freedom means someone else making the choices for you.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 1em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 13px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; font: normal normal normal 1.3em/1.5em georgia, serif; clear: both; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">More telling is Jobs&#8217; view that the p.c. world is &#8220;slipping away.&#8221; There&#8217;s a lot about the p.c. world we&#8217;d all like to see disappear, but freedom to make our own choices is not one of them. It&#8217;s at the core of the value, not something to dismiss as outmoded.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 1em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 13px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; font: normal normal normal 1.3em/1.5em georgia, serif; clear: both; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">The competition in the mobile arena, notably Google&#8217;s Android operating system, is entirely about being open. It&#8217;s one reason I own a Nexus One phone, the Google device that mostly lets me decide what I choose to do with it.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 1em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 13px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; font: normal normal normal 1.3em/1.5em georgia, serif; clear: both; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">There&#8217;s plenty of evidence that lots of people <em>want</em> to live in Steve&#8217;s Walled Garden. They <em>want</em> him and his minions to make their choices. They <em>want</em> to save time and trouble.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 1em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 13px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; font: normal normal normal 1.3em/1.5em georgia, serif; clear: both; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">Which is why Apple and Jobs could resolve this issue in a heartbeat. They could encourage users to use only the Apple-approved apps and see only the Apple-approved content. Many, maybe most, would do that.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 1em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 13px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; font: normal normal normal 1.3em/1.5em georgia, serif; clear: both; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">But Apple could then create a setting that does what the iPhone jailbreakers do unofficially: open the device for unapproved uses. It could come with a stern message like this: &#8220;By clicking here, you will be exposing yourself to risks we can&#8217;t control.&#8221;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 1em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 13px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; font: normal normal normal 1.3em/1.5em georgia, serif; clear: both; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">Right. Just like my Mac. Just like real life.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>One of the weirder memes I&#8217;ve seen in a while has emerged among some iPads fanatics. In this instance, at least a few folks are thrilled by one of the device&#8217;s major shortcomings.</p>
<p><a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/marc/">Mark Hedlund</a>, for example, is a super-smart guy. But I&#8217;m baffled by <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2010/05/the-ipad-and-immersive-computi.html">his post</a> praising the iPad for its lack of multitasking capabilities &#8212; running more than one program at once so users can a) let automatic updates occur behind the scenes while they do stuff, such as read or work, in the foreground; and b) quickly switch back and forth, working on several tasks in a quasi-parallel mode.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not the only one who thinks multitasking is an essential part of a modern computing device. In Apple&#8217;s case, <del>the Pope</del> Steve Jobs has decreed multitasking will be in the next version of the iPhone operating system, which is also the software heart of the iPad.</p>
<p>In any event, Marc writes that the iPad is in a different category from a personal computer. I agree on that, to a degree, but consider what that means to Marc:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I love how focused I am using an iPad, versus working on a laptop. New mail isn&#8217;t constantly arriving; tweets aren&#8217;t <a href="http://growl.info/">Growling</a> into view; I don&#8217;t even have an RSS reader installed. Instead I&#8217;m just reading a book or just playing a game or maybe just working. This is a huge relief, an antidote to interruption. (I&#8217;m sure having more than just one app running, as promised in OS 4.0, will be a benefit in some ways, but for today I love not having it.)</em></p>
<p><em>That focus, plus the direct manipulation interface that loses mouse and keyboard in favor of pointing and tapping, makes the experience of using an app more intimate than on a laptop. I think now of personal computing and iPad computing as significantly different. It&#8217;s not just a different form factor, but a different kind of work that I do on the iPad. Put simply, it seems to produce a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_%28psychology%29">flow state</a> much more easily for me, and once I&#8217;m in it, I fall out into distraction much less easily.</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p></blockquote>
<p>I confess, I don&#8217;t get it.</p>
<p>Although the Mac I&#8217;m using to write this posting has multitasking built into the operating system, it&#8217;s my decision whether to become distracted or not as I work. I choose, at the moment, not to be distracted by Twitter, email or the latest news from my favorite journalists and bloggers. I choose to be writing this post, and I&#8217;ll stop when I&#8217;m finished.</p>
<p>I can prevent email and Tweets from arriving (and often do) without crippling the computer. Here&#8217;s my system: I often shut down my email and Twitter software when I&#8217;m working on a blog post or book chapter or anything else demanding as much of my attention as I&#8217;m able to give. Works like a charm, and when I want to leave myself open to distraction again I start up the other software.</p>
<p>Again, I&#8217;m not oblivious to Marc&#8217;s basic point: He doesn&#8217;t see the iPad as a a computer as much as a device that he <em>wants</em> to use for only one thing at a time, given its size and features. When I get a tablet device, however, I&#8217;ll want the option even if I rarely use it.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Under entirely justified attack from people who care about preserving what&#8217;s left of their privacy online, Facebook is <a href="http://www.facebook.com/privacy/explanation.php">modifying the unilateral changes</a> it recently made in the service &#8212; changes that have exposed much more information by default than users have either understood or, in many cases, wanted.</p>
<p>Naturally, the corporate spin has tried to disguise the harsh reality. Under the name of Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg we read <a href="http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=391922327130">this blog post</a>, which includes this paragraph:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>The number one thing we&#8217;ve heard is that there just needs to be a simpler way to control your information. We&#8217;ve always offered a lot of controls, but if you find them too hard to use then you won&#8217;t feel like you have control. Unless you feel in control, then you won&#8217;t be comfortable sharing and our service will be less useful for you. We agree we need to improve this.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s impossible for anyone other than Facebook to say if this is the truth; only the company can count the communications it has received from users. I don&#8217;t believe this spin, because the criticism I&#8217;ve heard has not just been about simpler control. It&#8217;s been about the constant encroachments on people&#8217;s privacy that Facebook has been making for several years now. As IBM&#8217;s Matt McKeon brilliantly illustrated in <a href="http://mattmckeon.com/facebook-privacy/">his visualization</a>, the default settings have exposed vastly more personal information:</p>
<p><a href="http://mattmckeon.com/facebook-privacy/"><img class="alignnone" style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; border: 0pt none;" title="Facebook 2005" src="http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/facebook2005.png" border="0" alt="facebook in 2005" width="272" height="219" /></a></p>
<p><img src="file:///Users/dg/Pictures/fb2010.png" alt="" /><a href="http://mattmckeon.com/facebook-privacy/"><img class="size-full wp-image-1604 alignnone" title="Facebook 2010" src="http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/fb2010-e1274905890352.png" alt="Facebook 2010" width="272" height="219" /></a></p>
<p>Look at the original visualization to see how profoundly and systematically Facebook has made these encroachments on privacy as the years passed. These were systematic violations of trust.</p>
<p>To be sure, the latest changes will help. They do not go far enough, however, and along with the company&#8217;s obfuscation of the issues they only reinforce my strong belief that Facebook has a long, long way to go before it&#8217;ll re-earn any of my faith or trust.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still not planning to delete my account entirely. I need to understand what goes on inside Facebook in order to do my work properly. As noted earlier on this blog, I made a pretty drastic change myself a few months back: <a href="http://mediactive.com/2009/12/12/facebook-starting-over/">deleting my account and restarting it</a> in a much-reduced way. For now I&#8217;ll stay with this arrangement.</p>
<p>Which reminds me: If you friend me on Facebook, please only do so if you&#8217;re an actual friend. If you want to connect with me in a business or professional context, please <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/dangillmor">use LinkedIn</a>.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>UPDATED</p>
<p>As expected, Google TV was announced at this morning&#8217;s <a href="http://code.google.com/events/io/2010/">I/O keynote</a> (here&#8217;s the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/googledevelopers">video</a> site). There&#8217;s so much to think about in this initiative. One strikes me as especially intriguing: This is a big boost for micro-niche video.</p>
<p>Clearly, a ton of development has gone into the overall notion. Some of the platform pieces are quite clever, including basing it on Android, the open-source operating system that is now running dozens of phones and other small devices. And what Google brings to the ecosystem in other ways will be a powerful incentive for many other participants.</p>
<p>Google seems to be focusing mostly on the value it sees in combining Hollywood with Google. Semi-ugh. To the extent that Google gets in bed with the copyright cartel, it becomes a partner to an industry that wants to impede progress, not make it.</p>
<p>So when Eric Schmidt was joined on stage by Sony CEO Howard Stringer at I/O, and when &#8220;content providers&#8221; like the NBA showed off what they want to do with this new system, I mostly shuddered at the prospect of DRM-laden crapola invading my life in new, annoying and ultimately dangerous ways.﻿ (DRM stands for &#8220;digital rights management,&#8221; but really means &#8220;digital restrictions management.&#8221;)</p>
<p>What I prefer to focus on, however, is another of the ecosystem&#8217;s more intriguing (for me) possibilities: microchannels of content that will be simple to create and watch &#8212; and much easier than in the past to monetize.</p>
<p>﻿Micro-niche video has been around for a long time now. I can remember back in the late 1990s when sites like the now-defunct Pseudo offered a variety of narrowly tailored programming, and how much I relished the idea of combining the then-new DVR with the Internet and my personal tastes.</p>
<p>What Google is doing now is putting together a jigsaw puzzle that, if I understand what&#8217;s happening, could be one of the breakthroughs we&#8217;ve been waiting for. Here are the key pieces:</p>
<p><strong>First</strong>, this is a serious and useful linking of the Web and TV. Google is working to create a reasonably seamless experience where we can use both to their best effect, with integrated search and more. It&#8217;s not the first thing of its kind, but it does seem to stretch the genre.</p>
<p><strong>Second</strong>, Google brings with it an advertising marketplace. I can&#8217;t overstate how important this is. Niche content will have an instant way to find not just an audience but the advertising to help support it. (Now I see how Google really plans to make YouTube pay for itself, and then some.) The more niche the topic, the more the ads can be considered useful content as opposed to irrelevant annoyances.</p>
<p><strong>Third</strong>, niches are sociable experiences if we want them to be. We love to talk about what we really know, or care about, with others who feel the same way.</p>
<p>The possibilities are almost infinite. I&#8217;d tune in to the Alpine Skiing Channel or the Acoustic       Folk Music from the 1960s Channel       or Civil War Channel or My Hometown Neighborhood Channel if they  existed. And I&#8217;d participate in a social media conversation inside of them.</p>
<p>﻿What could go wrong? Lots of things. Not least of those is a victory by the telecommunications carriers in their fight against what folks call network neutrality, the idea that we users of the Internet should decide what we want to see and do, rather than having the carriers decide what bits of information we get, if we get them.</p>
<p>Even worse with the wireless piece: Building great stuff into an operating system doesn&#8217;t guarantee you can use it if the carriers decide to limit your bandwidth, or any number of other control-freakish stuff they may try (in fairness, sometimes, to keep the networks running for people who want to, um, make phone calls or send low-bandwidth text messages).</p>
<p>But let&#8217;s focus on the potential: TV may be about to get a <em>lot</em> more interesting&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I love the <a href="http://unite.hackshackers.com/">Hacks/Hackers Unite</a> idea &#8212; getting journalists and programmers and designers together to identify good ideas and hack them together. And I was considering attending this weekend&#8217;s event in San Francisco until I saw the agenda:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>bringing together journalists and media makers with hackers and designers to build the killer media app for the iPad and other tablet devices.  This event will be both a coding development camp and a journalistic boot camp. Teams of hacks (content creators) and hackers (developers and designers) will cooperate to tell develop media applications for the iPad and tablets that help inform, enlighten and tell stories for the public good. You can also build tablet-based tools for journalists.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;d have attended except that organizers are ignoring a crucial reality: the violation of journalistic principles inherent in participating in a closed ecosystem that the vendor, not the journalists, will control. Apple, and Apple alone, gets to decide if the journalism apps the hackers create for the iPad &#8212; and the journalism they contain &#8212; are acceptable. And that&#8217;s unacceptable.</p>
<p>Some of the <a href="http://www.google.com/moderator/#15/e=65ee&amp;t=65ee.40&amp;f=65ee.29d66">ideas people have posted</a> for the weekend development &#8212; and they&#8217;re quite creative &#8212; must assume Apple&#8217;s approval of what they do, a risky assumption given the company&#8217;s capricious and opaque rulings about what can be on devices running the iPhone OS. Other ideas, relying on the still-unfinished HTML5, seem not to realize that developers the iPad browser forfeit some of the iPad&#8217;s key hardware value, e.g. output from various sensors, because Apple won&#8217;t allow browser applications full access to the device&#8217;s capabilities.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a sop to &#8220;other tablet devices&#8221; in the event description. But that&#8217;s not very realistic given that Apple forbids development of iPhone OS apps using any tools but the ones it provides &#8212; for practical purposes, obliging people developing for the iPad and those other devices to do everything twice, using different tools and even languages. The effect, as Apple intends, is to persuade people to develop mobile apps only for Apple devices.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s where I&#8217;m focusing my thinking about tablets and outside-the-box journalistic ideas:</p>
<p>Tomorrow morning I&#8217;ll be at the <a href="http://code.google.com/events/io/2010/">Google I/O</a> conference. Rumors abound that Google may unveil a prototype of an Android tablet. It would be easy enough; essentially, it means putting the Android phone OS on a bigger screen, as Dell is planning to do sometime this year. Android is open-source; Google&#8217;s restrictions (or mobile carriers&#8217;) have relatively easy workarounds, and the main point is that Google doesn&#8217;t decide what apps can use what device features or which apps developers can sell.</p>
<p>I will be working on a tablet-based app or two in the coming months, including something I hope to sell or give away as part of the Mediactive project. But there&#8217;s no way I&#8217;ll let Apple decide if what I&#8217;m doing is allowed. This means I&#8217;ll focus my efforts on Android and any other tablet OS that doesn&#8217;t force me to ask permission.</p>
<p>On Saturday, I&#8217;ll head down to the <a href="http://www.makerfaire.com/bayarea/">Maker Faire</a> in San Mateo. What&#8217;s that about? From the Maker Faire website FAQ:</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #333333; font-family: arial, 'helvetica neue', helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 12px;"><em>Our mission at </em><a style="color: #004883;" href="http://www.makermedia.com"><em>Maker Media</em></a><em>, a division of O&#8217;Reilly Media and home to MAKE Magazine, Maker Faire and the host of other inspirational and instructional Maker Media brands, is to unite, inspire, inform, and entertain a growing community of highly imaginative and resourceful people who undertake amazing projects in their backyards, basements, and garages. We call these people &#8220;Makers.&#8221; ﻿</em></span></span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #333333; font-family: arial, 'helvetica neue', helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 12px;">I wish I could unite the Hacks/Hackers folks with the Maker Faire people. Journalists definitely need to work with programmers. I suspect they need to work even more with the Makers of the world who dream way, way, way outside the boundaries that companies like Apple are creating. Ask permission? These folks laugh at the very notion.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333; font-family: arial, 'helvetica neue', helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 12px;">UPDATE: See the comments, where an organizer of the Hacks/Hackers event response.<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Here&#8217;s a question I hope you&#8217;ll take a crack at answering, and not just because you might win a phone if you come up with the best answer:</p>
<p><em>What single thing can each of us do to to assure that we and our communities (of interest and geography) have enough trustworthy, useful information?</em>﻿</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the “<a href="http://www.ideasproject.com/qa.webui?id=5338&amp;answer=true" target="_blank">Question of the Week</a>“﻿  at Nokia’s <a href="http://www.ideasproject.com" target="_blank">IdeasProject.com</a>. The idea is that once a week, someone involved in the project asks a question that sparks some interesting ideas and conversation.</p>
<p>Next Sunday, I&#8217;ll pick the best response. Remember, I&#8217;m looking for a single thing we each can do; you probably have a dozen good suggestions, but pick the one that will give us the greatest return for our time.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a reward for the best answer: The one who comes up with it gets a Nokia phone.</p>
<p>Some background to my question, which will come as no surprise to anyone who&#8217;s been following our conversations here already:</p>
<p>We are in a splintering media world where anyone can commit a globally visible act of journalism &#8212; or deception. This means we&#8217;re awash in both good and bad information, and if <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturgeon's_Law">Theodore Sturgeon&#8217;s maxim</a> is true, most of it is crud. But with the huge amount of new stuff out there, this also means that there&#8217;s an enormous amount of good stuff, too.</p>
<p>So how do we sort the good from the bad? I&#8217;ve discussed it at some length in my own new project, but I&#8217;d like to be sure I haven&#8217;t missed anything.﻿</p>
<p>To answer the question, visit <a href="http://bit.ly/9HOh7x">http://bit.ly/9HOh7x﻿</a> to get directly to the Question of the Week. I&#8217;ll be updating here and on Twitter during the week. Please use the hashtag “#ideasproject”.</p>
<p>While you&#8217;re visiting IdeasProject.com, be sure to spend a little time looking at the other folks who&#8217;ve contributed not just the weekly questions but a whole variety of other thoughts, including Clay Shirky, Charlene Li, Robert Scoble and many others.</p>
<p>Several disclosures: Nokia is giving me one of their Netbooks in return for participating in this feature; I plan to donate it to a local school. In addition, in 2009 Nokia purchased Dopplr.com, a company I co-founded. I also have friends at Nokia, and the company gave us some phones several years ago to do mobile experiments as part of student projects.</p>

<p>I think it&#8217;s arrogance, not cowardice. But it&#8217;s an outrage either way.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Some members of the traditional publishing industry don&#8217;t care for what I write, and some who do aren&#8217;t thrilled with one of the ways I try to spread my ideas. So when <em>Mediactive </em>appears between dead-tree covers a bit later this year, the traditional publishing industry won&#8217;t be in the mix.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going with <a href="http://lulu.com">Lulu</a>, a company that understands the changes in media. This is a self-publishing service &#8212; an operation that takes my work and turns it into books that can be sold, by me and by anyone else who wants to sell them.</p>
<p>Some background: Last fall, when I started serious work on the book part of this project, I was under contract to the <a href="http://oreilly.com">publisher</a> that brought out <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596102275?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=dangillcom-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0596102275"><em>We the Media</em></a><em><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=dangillcom-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0596102275" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" /></em> a few years ago; we parted company in January. At which point, my literary agent &#8212; the beyond-terrific David Miller of the <a href="http://garamondagency.com">Garamond Agency</a> &#8212; started looking for a new publisher.</p>
<p>My former publisher was fine with Creative Commons, as proved by the fact that we did the first book that way. But as David told me at the outset of the new search, I was likely to limit the potential field because I had one non-negotiable requirement: The book will be published under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a> license. In this case, as with <em>We the Media</em>, the kind of Creative Commons license would say, essentially, that anyone could make copies of the work for non-commercial use, and if they created derivative works, also only for non-commercial purposes, those works would have to be made available a) with credit to me and b) under the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/">same license</a>.</p>
<p>The principle was simple: While I want my writing to get the widest possible distribution, if anyone is going to make money on it I&#8217;d like that to be me, my publisher and my agent.</p>
<p>Almost a decade after Creative Commons was founded, and despite ample evidence that licensing copyrighted works this way doesn&#8217;t harm sales, book publishers remain mostly clueless and/or hostile. As David explained to editors, the main reason <em><strong>I&#8217;m still getting royalty checks</strong></em> for <em>We the Media</em> is that the book has been available as a free download since the day it went into bookstores. Had we not published it that way, given the indifference (at best) shown by American newspapers and magazines, the book would have sunk without a trace.</p>
<p>That logic persuaded no one in New York (not that we got that far in most cases &#8212; more about that below). And to my genuine if not major regret, the Creative Commons roadblock forced me to turn down a deal from a publisher that would have been perfect for this project had I only been writing a book and nothing more.</p>
<p>Two points: First, and most obviously, if a principle means anything, you stick by it when doing so is inconvenient, not just when it&#8217;s easy. Second, this isn&#8217;t just a book, at least not way traditional publishers understand books even as they dabble online.</p>
<p>To publishers, books are items they manufacture and send out in trucks. Or else they&#8217;re computer files to be rented to publishers&#8217; customers, or customers of Amazon, Apple and other companies that use proprietary e-reading software to lock the work down in every possible way. In both cases, publishers crave being the gatekeepers.</p>
<p>Mediactive aims to be a multi-faceted project. Over the next few years, I hope to experiment in lots of media formats and styles with the ideas here. And &#8212; this is key &#8212; I also plan to experiment with it in the broader context of the emerging ecosystem of ideas.</p>
<p>That ecosystem is evolving at an accelerating rate, and the people who have had specific roles in the one that prevailed in the past &#8212; authors, literary agents, <a href="http://monitortalent.com">speaking agents</a>, <a href="http://tomstites.com">editors</a>, publishers and others &#8212; are going to have to change with it. Some get this and some don&#8217;t, but I&#8217;m happy to say that the people I work with directly at this point are definitely in the getting-it category. (I&#8217;ll talk much more about this broader context in an upcoming post.)</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I&#8217;m having terrific conversations with the folks at Lulu. They aren&#8217;t the only outfit of this kind around, by any means, but I like the way they see their own part of the emerging ecosystem.</p>
<p>Incidentally, had I signed with a traditional publisher, the book would not have reached the marketplace for a year, most likely, if not even later. With Lulu, it&#8217;ll be available this summer.</p>
<h4>Rejections</h4>
<p>Editors from big publishing houses have a habit of rejecting books in what they must believe is a kind way. They say something to this effect: &#8220;It&#8217;s really interesting and we like Dan a bunch, and while it isn&#8217;t for us we&#8217;re sure it&#8217;ll find a great home with someone else.&#8221;</p>
<p>Please, folks. Any competent author would prefer this: &#8220;We didn&#8217;t like it, and here&#8217;s why&#8230;.&#8221; ﻿Honest criticism is more helpful.</p>
<p>One reason several editors did offer was a bit surprising. An editor wrote, echoing several others, &#8220;The main problem that people had was that they felt that they knew much of the information that Dan was trying to get across&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Wow. You mean that people <em>who read and publish books for a living</em> already know the value of deep and thoughtful media use? Uh, one of the major motivations for this project is the ample evidence that way too many other people <em>don&#8217;t</em> know this.</p>
<p>In my days as a newspaper reporter, I learned that the only audience that really counts is your editor. It  was a reality in the world of highly concentrated media, but no more. Any serious writer needs a good editor, but people who become your audience &#8212; and if you do it right, your collaborators &#8212; are the ones who really count.</p>
<p>Another reason for saying No had the ring of actual truth: The publisher&#8217;s publicity and marketing people &#8220;felt that the major media would avoid the book because of the criticism of their techniques.﻿&#8221; One reason I&#8217;m writing it&#8230;</p>
<h4>Lulu</h4>
<p>It was after I turned down the New York publisher&#8217;s offer that I contacted <a href="http://lulupresscenter.com/executive/view/profile/bob_young">Bob Young</a>, Lulu&#8217;s founder and CEO. Bob also started <a href="http://redhat.com">Red Hat</a>, one of the first companies to prove that it was possible to make money with open-source software by providing services, and he&#8217;s been an ardent supporter of ensuring that what we call &#8220;intellectual property&#8221; involves as many choices as possible.</p>
<p>Bob had told me about Lulu several years earlier, and in that conversation he&#8217;d suggested it would be a good fit for me someday. Now, we both thought, this might really be the time.</p>
<p>He put me in touch with <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/danwideman">Daniel Wideman</a>, who runs what Lulu calls its new &#8220;VIP Services&#8221; for established authors making the move to this kind of publishing. Daniel said he very much liked what I was trying to accomplish in this new project, and we had several further discussions. In the end it was clear to me that this would indeed be a good fit.</p>
<p>So here we go. I&#8217;ll be letting you know how all this works, by which I mean many of the details of the process.</p>
<p>Back to work&#8230;my to-do list has just gotten a whole lot longer. But it&#8217;s <em>my</em> list this time.</p>

		<p>UPDATED</p>
<p>The FCC has decided that Hollywood&#8217;s copyright cartel will soon be able to <a href="http://preview.bloomberg.com/news/2010-05-07/film-studios-said-to-be-allowed-to-use-anti-piracy-technology-on-tv-sets.html">control </a><em><a href="http://preview.bloomberg.com/news/2010-05-07/film-studios-said-to-be-allowed-to-use-anti-piracy-technology-on-tv-sets.html">your</a></em><a href="http://preview.bloomberg.com/news/2010-05-07/film-studios-said-to-be-allowed-to-use-anti-piracy-technology-on-tv-sets.html"> television</a> &#8212; and ultimately much more &#8212; remotely. This is not a joke.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The FCC order “‘will allow the big firms for the first time to take control of a consumer’s TV set or set-top box, blocking viewing of a TV program or motion picture,” </em><a title="Search News" href="http://search.bloomberg.com/search?site=wnews&amp;client=wnews&amp;proxystylesheet=en10_wnews&amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;filter=p&amp;getfields=wnnis&amp;partialfields=-wnnis:NOAVSYND&amp;sort=date:D:S:d1&amp;lr=-lang_ja&amp;q=Gigi%20Sohn"><em>Gigi Sohn</em></a><em>, president of Washington-based Public Knowledge, said in a statement.﻿ </em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m old enough to remember the introduction to a long-ago TV show called the Outer Limits. Science fiction often comes true.</p>

</p>
<p>UPDATE: Cory Doctorow at BoingBoing, who has much more technical depth on these issues, <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2010/05/07/fcc-hands-hollywood.html">explains clearly</a> what&#8217;s going on &#8212; and how this is about much more than just your TV. It&#8217;s about all electronics you use. Thought you owned that new PC or Mac? Think again.</p>
