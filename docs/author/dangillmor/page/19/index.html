	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><em>Next week I&#8217;ll be attending a <a href="http://www.paleycenter.org/mc-news-frontier-2">one-day conference</a> at the <a href="http://www.paleycenter.org/">Paley Center for Media</a> in New York. The center and the <a href="http://carnegie.org/">Carnegie Corp.</a> are asking what the future of journalism education should be &#8212; who should do it, how it should be done, and for what purpose.</em></p>
<p><em>I&#8217;ve been thinking about this for some time, and have blogged a number of ideas in the past several years, and one chapter in my upcoming book, Mediactive, will look closely at media education. Here&#8217;s an excerpt:</em></p>
<p><em> </em>If I ran a journalism school, I would start with the same <a href="http://mediactive.com/principles/">basic principles</a> of honorable, high-quality journalism and mediactivism, and embed them at the core of everything else. If our students didn’t understand and appreciate them, nothing else we did would matter very much.</p>
<p>With the principles as the foundation, I would, among many other things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Emphasize undergraduate journalism degrees as great liberal arts programs, even more valuable that way than as training for journalism careers. At the same time, focus graduate journalism studies on helping people with expertise in specific areas to be the best possible journalists in their fields.</li>
<li>Do away with the still-common “track” system for would-be journalists where students focus on print, broadcast, online, etc. These are merging. There would be one track. We wouldn’t just recognize our students’ digital future; we’d immerse them in it.</li>
<li>Encourage, and require in some cases, cross-disciplinary learning and doing. We’d create partnerships around the university, working with business, engineering/computer science, film, political science, law, design and many other programs. The goals would be both to develop our own projects and to be an essential community-wide resource for the future of local media.</li>
<li>Teach students not just the basics of digital media but also the value of data and programming to their future work. This doesn’t necessarily mean that they need to become programmers; but they absolutely need to know how to communicate with programmers. We’d also encourage computer science undergraduates to become journalism graduate students, so they can help create tomorrow’s media.</li>
<li>Require all students to learn basic statistics, survey research and fundamental scientific methodology. The inability of journalists to understand what they’re reading is one of journalism’s &#8212; and society’s &#8212; major flaws.</li>
<li>Encourage a research agenda with deep connections to key media issues of today. More than ever, we need solid data and rigorous analysis. And translate faculty research into language average people can understand as opposed to the dense, even impenetrable, prose that’s clear (if it really is) only to readers of academic journals.</li>
<li>Require all journalism students to understand business concepts, especially those relating to media. This is not just to cure the longstanding ignorance of business issues in the craft, but also to recognize that today’s students will be among the people who develop tomorrow’s journalism business models. We’d discuss for-profit and not-for-profit methods, and look at advertising, marketing, social networking, and search-engine optimization, among many other elements.</li>
<li>Make entrepreneurship a core part of journalism education. <a href="http://cronkite.asu.edu">Arizona State University</a>, where I’m working, is among several schools working on this, and the early experiments are gratifying. Several of our student projects have won funding. At City University of New York, Jeff Jarvis has received foundation <a href="http://entrepreneurialjourno.pbworks.com/cuny">funding for student projects</a> to continue after the class is over, based on semester-ending competitive “pitches” to a judging panel of journalists and investors. We need to see more and more of these and other kinds of experiments.</li>
<li>Recognize that not all, and probably not most, students will end up as entrepreneurs. But they will all come to appreciate two key elements of entrepreneurship. One is the notion of taking ownership of a process and outcome. The other, which may be the most important single thing students &#8212; of all kinds &#8212; need in this fast-changing world is an appreciation of ambiguity, and the ability to deal with it. This means reacting to changes around us, being flexible and swift when circumstances change. Ambiguity is not something to fear; it is part of our lives, and we need to embrace it.</li>
<li>In a related area, recognize that many of our best students, particularly the ones with a genuine entrepreneurial bent, will not graduate as scheduled, if ever. They’ll create or join startups while they have the passion and energy, and we should encourage them to try.</li>
<li>Appreciate our graduates no matter where their careers have taken them. If we understand that journalism education is a valuable step into any number of professions, we should not just celebrate the graduates who’ve gone on to fame (if not fortune) in journalism, but also those who’ve made marks in other fields.</li>
<li>Persuade the president (or chancellor or whatever the title) and trustees of the university that every student on the campus should learn journalism principles and skills before graduating, preferably during freshman year. At State University of New York’s Stony Book campus, the journalism school has been given a special mandate of exactly this kind. Howard Schneider, a former newspaper journalist who now is dean of Stony Brook’s journalism school, won foundation funding to bring <a href="http://www.stonybrook.edu/journalism/cfnlindex.shtml">news literacy</a> into the university’s broader community, not just those enrolled in journalism courses.</li>
<li>Create a program of the same kind for people in the community, starting with teachers. Our goal would be to help schools across our geographical area bring mediactivism to every level of education—not just college, but also grade, middle, and high school. We would offer workshops, conferences and online training.</li>
<li>Offer that program, or one like it, to concerned parents who feel overwhelmed by the media deluge themselves, to help turn them into better media consumers and to give them ways to help their children.</li>
<li>Keep what we now call public relations as part of the mission, but move it into a separate program. Call it “Persuasion,” and include marketing and other kinds of non-journalistic advocacy in this category. As we recognize that the lines are blurring, sometimes uncomfortably, we’ll require all journalism students to learn the techniques of persuasion. But Persuasion majors would conversely be steeped in the principles of honorable media creation.</li>
<li>Provide for-fee training to communicators who work in major local institutions, such as PR and marketing folks from private companies, governmental organizations, and others. If they could be persuaded that the principles matter, they might offer the public less BS and more reality, and we’d all be better off for the exercise.</li>
<li>Enlist another vital player in the effort to help people appreciate the value of solid, ethical journalism: local media of all kinds, not just traditional media. Of course, as noted earlier, they should be making this a core part of their missions, given that their own credibility would rise if they helped people understand the principles and process of quality journalism. But we’d very much want to work with local new media organizations and individuals, too.</li>
<li>Advise and train citizen journalists to understand and apply the principles and best practices. They are going to be an essential part of the local journalism ecosystem, and we should reach out to show them how we can help.</li>
<li>Augment local media with our own journalism. We train students to do journalism, after all, and their work should be widely available in the community, particularly when it fills in gaps left by the shrinking traditional media. At Arizona State, the <a href="http://cronkitenews.asu.edu">Cronkite News Service</a> provides all kinds of coverage of topics the local news organizations rarely cover, making our students’ work available to those organizations. Soon, we’ll be publishing it ourselves on our own website.</li>
</ul>
<p>All this suggests a considerably broader mission for journalism schools and programs than the one they’ve had in the past. It also suggests a huge opportunity for journalism schools. The need for this kind of training has never been greater. We’re not the only ones who can do it, but we may be among the best equipped.</p>
<p><em>Note: Seth Lewis at the Nieman Journalism Lab is <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2010/02/what-is-journalism-school-for-a-call-for-input/">looking for ideas</a> in this space. He&#8217;s dead-on in wanting to see students come out of the experience with great flexibility, and his piece has already attracted some excellent comments.</em></p>

		<p>Alan Rusbridger, editor of the Guardian, has published a lecture he gave this week. He asks, &#8220;<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2010/jan/25/cudlipp-lecture-alan-rusbridger">Does journalism exist?</a>&#8221; &#8212; and his answers, as you&#8217;d expect, are a must-read for anyone who cares about the future of journalism.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m tempted to quote from pieces of his talk. But it&#8217;s so meaty that I want to encourage you to take the time to read it for yourself. The lecture ranges widely &#8212; including the question of who&#8217;ll actually pay for information in the future. </p>
<p>When you&#8217;re done reading it, you&#8217;ll understand better why the organization Alan leads has deservedly become one of the most widely followed news sites in the English language.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Another not-for-profit news organization is launching soon &#8212; the <a href="http://www.bayareanewsproject.org/">Bay Area News Project</a>. It&#8217;s a worthy and important development in a metropolitan area that&#8217;s been watching (assuming that folks are actually paying attention) the slow-motion disintegration of newspaper journalism, and I&#8217;m a big fan of the founding editor, <a href="http://www.newwest.net/member/bio/1229/">Jonathan Weber</a>, who&#8217;s coming back to town from his five-year sojourn in Montana.</p>
<p><img src="http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/cash.jpg" border="0" alt="cash.jpg" width="250" height="275" align="left" />But I&#8217;m disheartened <a href="http://www.mediabistro.com/baynewser/bay_area_news_project/qa_lisa_frazier_ceo_bay_area_news_project_149653.asp">by the news</a> that the CEO &#8212; Lisa Frazier, who as far as I can tell has had little or no experience actually managing a news operation (she&#8217;s been a consultant to some big media orgs) &#8212; is being paid $400,000. Maybe she&#8217;s worth that much in the corporate world.</p>
<p>But this is an exorbitant salary for a fledgling nonprofit that will never be all very big compared to the kinds of nonprofits (universities, hospitals, major NGOs, etc.) that pay salaries of this kind. (And some of them go <em>way</em> over the top.)</p>
<p>Frazier&#8217;s pay isn&#8217;t nearly as much as <a href="http://mediactive.com/2009/10/01/non-profit-media-what-you-pay-for-and-who-pays/">Paul Steiger&#8217;s princely score</a> at another nonprofit, <a href="http://propublica.org">ProPublica</a>, but it&#8217;s just as over-the-top in its own way.</p>
<p>Please understand: I support the goals of these organizations. ProPublica&#8217;s journalism to date has been praiseworthy, sometimes superb, and I have no doubt that Jonathan Weber will lead the Bay Area project to do fine work as well.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s clear that the principal funders and boards of directors of both projects have tin ears about how the public correctly sees not-for-profit enterprises &#8212; as organizations that people join not to make a pile of money but because they want to make the world better in some way. I&#8217;m not saying these CEOs should work for a pittance. I am saying that their pay scales send a message they may someday regret.</p>
<p>My bottom line with the Bay Area project, as with ProPublica, is this: I offer my best wishes and moral support for their journalistic  activities, but I won&#8217;t donate any money &#8212; because the message I get from the CEO pay is that they don&#8217;t need my money. I&#8217;ll reserve my financial support for the ones that do.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>You may think you own the device you bought last week from a retailer. What you own, increasingly, is only the hardware; what you don’t own is the right to use it the way you want to use it, even for entirely legal purposes.</p>
<p>Jonathan Zittrain, a Harvard law professor and author of <a href="http://futureoftheinternet.org/"><em>The Future of the Internet &#8212; and How to Stop It</em></a>, has described a potential future in which the very qualities that have made personal computing and the Internet so valuable &#8212; namely their openness to add-on innovation &#8212; are in danger. We are on the verge of a major test of his predictions: the upcoming introduction of Apple&#8217;s tablet computer.</p>
<p>Where the personal computer and early Internet were a wide-open collection of technologies, on which anyone could build software and services, governments, the technology and media industries have increasingly wanted to clamp down on your freedoms. Apple has been increasingly clear that it intends to be one of the most insistent control freaks, and the &#8220;iSlate&#8221; or whatever it&#8217;s going to be called may well announce the company&#8217;s long-term vision &#8212; and not in a way we should want it to go.</p>
<p>The iPhone was Apple&#8217;s first statement along these lines, and it was a big switch from what had come before. With the Macintosh computer, Apple built an ecosystem for software developers. Anyone could write for the Mac, and still can, just as they can for Windows and Linux and other computer operating systems.</p>
<p>With the iPhone, Apple took its experience with the iTunes Music Store and created an iPhone applications software retailing system. But to reach iPhone users, developers had to get Apple’s permission to be listed in the store. Lots of them have, plainly, as the number of applications is said to be above 100,000; but there are well-documented horror stories featuring Apple’s refusal, on often <a href="http://apprejections.com/">mysterious</a> or <a href="streethttp://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/11/27/apple_doesnt_trust_you/print.html">capricious</a> grounds, to allow specific applications to be sold or even given away.</p>
<p>You can still create what you want on the Web, and iPhone users can still find it via the device’s Safari brower &#8212; sorry, no other browsers allowed &#8212; but if you want them to experience your work in any way that uses the hardware’s capabilities to their fullest, you need Apple’s permission. And if you get it and charge for your application, or for any services you provide via your application, Apple insists on taking a cut of the money.</p>
<p>I have an older iPhone. I used hackers&#8217; software to <a href="http://wikee.iphwn.org/">jailbreak and unlock</a> it, and used it on T-Mobile&#8217;s network. But when the &#8220;3G&#8221; iPhone came out, using AT&amp;T&#8217;s network that&#8217;s incompatible with T-Mobile&#8217;s faster one, I moved to Android. I still prefer the iPhone experience in many ways, but the lack of compatibility and Apple&#8217;s constant breaking of the jailbreak software made it crazy to continue.</p>
<p>So here&#8217;s the question. I don&#8217;t doubt that Apple, an absolute master of user experience, is about to sell a superb multimedia tablet computer that could be as pathbreaking in its genre as the iPhone was in its space.</p>
<p>Many media companies are talking with Apple about selling their content through the Apple tablet. Will they &#8212; and software developers &#8212; need Apple’s permission to make the best use of the hardware?</p>
<p>In other words, will the Apple tablet software model be the iPhone-style, control-freak system, or will it be the open-to-all Mac platform on a more portable device? Or to put it still another way, is the &#8220;you bought it but we control it&#8221; mentality moving up into what had been a relatively protected, i.e. open, part of the communications foodchain?</p>
<p>If Apple does the former and gets away with it, you can be sure others in the consumer-electronics arena will move in the same direction. Not all, thank goodness, but some major ones will try to make your decisions for you.</p>
<p>One that already does is Amazon. The <a href="http://amazon.com/kindle">Kindle</a> is the most popular e-reader by far. I own one (and I own some Amazon stock), but I am extremely unhappy at Amazon’s hard-nosed insistence that it can control your Kindle. The company was appropriately embarrassed (and had to pay out a court settlement) for remotely deleting several books by George Orwell &#8212; oh, the irony &#8212; from the Kindles of people who’s purchased the editions from what turned out to be a publisher that was unauthorized to sell them. While Amazon apologized, it didn’t say what would happen if some judge or government agency ordered it to remove books or other content from the devices in the future.</p>
<p>This is not just about your right to read and use media as you wish. It is also about the way you will be able to make available what you create in the future. If you believe in freedom of speech, you should be deeply alarmed by the trends we’re seeing.</p>
<p>And if media companies think the Apple tablet is their salvation, they should consider what they may be signing up for. Turning their futures over to Apple doesn&#8217;t strike me as a solution to anything.</p>
