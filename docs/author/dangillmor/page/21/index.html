	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>So it&#8217;s official. Comcast has <a href="http://news.google.com/news?q=comcast+nbc&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=GeoXS86pI5T8tQPCh92lDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=news_group&amp;ct=title&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBIQsQQwAA">announced its intention to buy NBC Universal</a> from GE. The danger of this cannot be overstated, but it could actually be the catalyst for a policy conversation the nation desperately needs to hold.</p>
<p>A Comcast-NBC combination is brazenly anti-competitve and anti-democratic.  It would give one company far too much ownership over not just professionally produced media but also the ways media consumers can receive it.</p>
<p>Worse, if approved, it could mark the tipping point in Big Media&#8217;s push to take control over the Internet itself. That&#8217;s where we need to focus our attention.</p>
<p>We can come out of this the right way if the announced deal prompts Congress to stop ducking <em>the</em> key media consolidation issue of our time. If we can use data networks the way we choose, the traditional fears about media consolidation &#8212; the concentration of mass media in the hands of a few immensely powerful corporations &#8212; lessen over time. They&#8217;re still worth worrying about, but not as much.</p>
<p>No, the issue now is the truly scary media consolidation we face: the &#8220;broadband&#8221; duopoly&#8217;s increasing control over what we can do with <em>our</em> media. The cable and phone giants are determined to decide what bits get delivered in what order, at what speed and at what time &#8212; if they get delivered at all &#8212; to the people who want them.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been obvious for years that a day like this was coming. From <em><a href="http://wethemedia.oreilly.com">We the Media</a></em> in 2004 (and I was hardly the first person to notice):</p>
<blockquote><p><em>In a world where we may end up with one, two, or at most three broadband telecommunications providers in any given community, the end-to-end principle is in serious jeopardy. Should giant telecommunications companies—namely cable and local phone providers—have vertical control over everything from the data transport to the content itself? For example, as I was writing this book, Comcast, the cable monopoly in my area, was trying to buy Disney. The attempt failed. If this happened, Comcast could have decided to deliver Disney’s content online more quickly than someone else’s, discriminating on the basis of financial considerations. Such a regime would have been a disaster for the unimpeded flow of information. We should insist on a more horizontal system, in which the owner of the pipe is obliged to provide interconnections to competing ser­vices. Unfortunately, today’s regulatory and political power bro­kers lean in the wrong direction.</em></p>
<p><em>&#8230;</em></p>
<p><em>The cable and phone companies have shown again and again that they abuse their power. They are historical monopo­lies with control over vast territories given to them by govern­ments. But they used to be regulated monopolies. Increasingly, they are freeing themselves of regulation.</em></p>
<p><em>&#8230;</p>
<p>The threat is still more theoretical than real, at least in the United States. People in China, where the govern­ment censors Internet content, know firsthand the danger of centralized choke points.</p>
<p></em></p></blockquote>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p>So now it&#8217;s real. What can we do?</p>
<p>First, recognize how networked media work, or should. In the traditional mass media days, people who worked for big businesses created media and distributed it; they manufactured stuff and put it in trucks, or broadcast it over one-way, one-to-many distributions systems.</p>
<p>In an Inter-networked world we create stuff, and then <em>we make it available, and other people come and get it</em>. People at the edges of networks make the decisions that matter, not the people who provide the data pipes. That&#8217;s how it should work, at any rate.</p>
<p>Second, this suggests we shouldn&#8217;t  obsess over what sound like huge issues but are actually peripheral. Specifically, I don&#8217;t care that much if Big Content ends up in just a few hands, as long as the rest of us can a) keep creating our own media and b) make it available on distributed networks without having to pay unjust toll charges.</p>
<p>Comcast has already started pushing its Internet users toward an entirely artificial pricing, putting usage caps on packet-switched data services, i.e. the Internet, for heavy users of data-rich applications, notably video. This has been a conflict of interest from the start, given that Comcast is primarily a video-delivery company for Big Content. Comcast&#8217;s data pipes could be used to provide much greater Internet bandwidth, but Comcast chooses to limit that kind of data, and not just for technical reasons.</p>
<p>Now that it would own one of the major Big Content companies, the conflicts of interest would expand in dramatic and obvious ways on the video side. I&#8217;m sure the other Big Content players can fend for themselves when it comes to keeping their cable channels; they have lots of financial and lobbying clout.</p>
<p>But the rest of us, especially the younger people who should be entering a data-networked world of nearly unlimited media choices, have less power. And we&#8217;re likely to be the ones, in the end, who lose the most.</p>
<p>Why? Because it will be in Comcast&#8217;s financial interest to clamp down as much as possible on Internet data use when it conflicts with its cable-TV business, which is to say on a constant basis.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that Comcast wouldn&#8217;t be the first company to have this kind of vertical content and distribution structure. Time Warner owns some cable franchises along with CNN and other media properties; Cablevision has its own content business. Phone companies have some projects under way, too.</p>
<p>The greater threat is where this deal would lead. It would set off a rush of other buyouts, moving more Big Content under the wings of the rest of the telecom companies. They&#8217;ll have the same incentives to restrict data usage, and unless they&#8217;re told not to do this by people who can make it stick, that&#8217;s exactly what they&#8217;ll do.</p>
<p>Understand this: The telecom companies are trying to remake the Internet into a form of cable television. It&#8217;s not because they&#8217;re evil, though they often behave in evil ways, but because it would be good business &#8212; for them, and the hell with the rest of us.</p>
<p>So where does Congress come into the picture? Everywhere, obviously, but I wish I had confidence in lawmakers&#8217; willingness to address this.</p>
<p>Keep in mind how people are elected today: for the most part, despite progress in Internet organizing and fundraising, via television advertising. Will Congress take on companies that control the biggest media? Have the lawmakers ever done this, at least in recent times? Nope.</p>
<p>Please be clear on what&#8217;s at stake: We are heading toward a level of media control that, if the telecom companies succeed in achieving it, will threaten every bit of the work I and many others have been doing for the past decade.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll say it again: This is <em>the</em> media-consolidation issue of the early 21st Century. If you care, call and/or write your member of Congress, before it&#8217;s too late.</p>

		<p>John Byrne, former editor of BusinessWeek, who&#8217;s starting a <a href="http://www.c-changemedia.com/2009/11/why-incumbent-media-will-continue-to.html">new venture</a>:<br />
<em><br />
<blockquote>I passionately believe that the future of media is digital and that newcomers have tremendous advantages over incumbents. Most of traditional media remains in a complete meltdown, dragged down by high costs, old ways of thinking, and legacy work processes. As tough as the past three years have been for traditional media, the next three are going to be nothing less than brutal: more closures, greater losses, increasing layoffs of highly talented journalists and editors.</p>
<p>That’s also why we’re going to see a media boom in the next three years, the launch of tens of thousands of new media entrepreneurs on the Internet. Many of them will fail, but many more will flourish and replace the brands our fathers and grandfathers grew up with. The success of Huffington Post, Politico, Drudge, GigaOm, TechCrunch, and other media enterprises on the web have shown us a path forward. But it’s still very early days and the new followers are going to have lots of advantages over the first movers. I’m thrilled and excited to be part of this revolution.</p></blockquote>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>UPDATED</p>
<p>As everyone knows, the nation&#8217;s scam artists, monopolists and market-riggers have all gone into hibernation during the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. This has given the Federal Trade Commission the breathing room it needs to intercede in an arena where its role is, at best, unclear.</p>
<p>This week, the commission is holding a two-day workshop entitled <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/opp/workshops/news/index.shtml">How Will Journalism Survive the Internet Age?</a> &#8212; the purpose of which is &#8220;to explore how the Internet has affected journalism.&#8221;</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/opp/workshops/news/agenda.pdf">agenda</a> &#8212; bizarrely available only in PDF format; would someone at the agency who has a clue kindly tell the public-affairs people that it&#8217;s okay to post such things in HTML? &#8212; suggests great breadth. Speakers include old-guard media barons like Rupert Murdoch and budding barons like Arianna Huffington, but also many of the traditional and new-media folks whose names show up again and again in places like Jim <a href="http://www.poynter.org/column.asp?id=45">Romenesko</a>&#8216;s Poynter blog. It&#8217;s an impressive list (and, disclosure, includes a bunch of friends as well as two university colleagues).</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll also note, however, that the schedule assures little depth. The time slots are arranged in a rapid-fire manner, with keynote-ish speakers having no real time to offer much more than their standard-issue talking points. Panels are even more lickety-split, with nine members in 90 minutes; let&#8217;s see, that&#8217;s about 8 minutes each plus introductions and no audience Q&amp;A, or 6 minutes each if you want to (very briefly) include the audience.</p>
<p>The event comes under the FTC&#8217;s Office of Policy Planning. Here&#8217;s <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/opp/about.shtm">its mission</a>:<br />
<em><br />
</em></p>
<blockquote><p><em>The Office of Policy Planning assists the Commission to develop and implement long-range competition and consumer protection policy initiatives and advises staff on cases raising new or complex policy and legal issues.</em></p>
<p><em>One of the Office of Policy Planning&#8217;s primary roles involves competition advocacy, submitting filings supporting competition principles to state legislatures, regulatory boards, and officials; state and federal courts; other federal agencies; and professional organizations. The Office also organizes public workshops and issues reports on cutting-edge competition and consumer protection topics, addressing questions of substantive antitrust law, industry-specific practices, and significant national and international policy debates.</em></p>
<p><em>In addition to the Office of Policy Planning, several offices throughout the Commission, including the Bureau of Competition’s Office of Policy and Coordination and the Policy Studies unit within the Office of the General Counsel, also provide policy advice.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><em> </em><br />
This has what to do with journalism, exactly?</p>
<p>Ah, we learn more in a <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/os/2009/09/090930mediaworkshopnotice.pdf">Federal Register Notice</a> (also PDF-only, naturally). The notice observes, in a promising start, that the Internet has created unparalleled possibilities.</p>
<p>The commission could have stopped there, and not bothered to hold the workshop. It could have recognized that we&#8217;re in the early days of a transition from one set of business models (most of which have not been very competitive) to an emerging, hyper-competitive sphere. There&#8217;s never been more reason for optimism than there is today, given the massive amount of journalistic and business experimentation going on all around us.</p>
<p>But the commission staff has much to fret about, spurred in large part by the incessant whining of the newspaper industry in recent times. (Could it also have been influenced by the fact that the FTC chairman is <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/commissioners/leibowitz/index.shtml">married</a> to a Washington Post <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">reporter</span> columnist? No, this obviously had absolutely no bearing on anything.) The commission has discovered that the advertising model which once supported many kinds of journalism has eroded. Quoting several economists, the workshop notice says &#8220;public affairs reporting may indeed be particularly subject to market failure.&#8221;</p>
<p>Market failure? What about the market failure &#8212; which as far as I can tell never got any attention from a succession of FTC people during the past half-century &#8212; of the monopolies and oligopolies created by media organizations during that period? The public affairs journalism was, for the most part, a modest spinoff of the extortionate advertising prices they charged when they had near-absolute market power to charge anything they wished. Only when there&#8217;s real competition does the FTC get interested.</p>
<p>The commission, inevitably, is asking for opinions on whether federal taxpayers should subsidize journalism more directly than the indirect subsidies of low postal rates for print; giveaways of publicly owned airwaves (spectrum) to broadcasters; the odious &#8220;Newspaper Preservation Act&#8221; granting partial antitrust immunity to community newspapers, etc. Several of the speakers are surely going to rise to that bait with a loud Yes. (Believe it or not, meanwhile, the commission is asking if Congress should give journalism-related businesses even more antitrust immunity. Good grief.)</p>
<p>There&#8217;s only one subsidy that makes sense, only one that wouldn&#8217;t put government meddling squarely into the practice of journalism, an inevitable result of the direct subsidies being pushed by well-meaning but misguided media thinkers. It&#8217;s not on the agenda, however.</p>
<p>Taxpayer-assisted infrastructure &#8212; especially the postal system and low rates for sending publications &#8212; <a href="http://mediactive.com/2009/05/13/governments-long-history-of-supporting-journalism/">helped create the newspaper business</a>, and enabled a lot of other commerce. <a href="http://mediactive.com/2009/10/30/the-only-journalism-subsidy-we-need-is-in-bandwidth/">Bring forward</a> that logic to high-speed Internet access for all Americans, and enable the 21st Century communications infrastructure for all competitors.</p>
<p>As it is, we&#8217;re moving toward a market failure of frightening proportions, as the telecom industry clamps down, or threatens to, on people&#8217;s ability to use Internet connections as they see fit. We&#8217;re moving toward a media business consolidation that would terrify make any real champion of open markets: a cable-phone duopoly.</p>
<p>The Federal Communications Commission has jurisdiction over telecom, and is looking at the issue. But when it comes to how journalism will thrive in (not just survive) the Internet age, this should be high on any list of competitive issues of interest to agencies that push for competitive markets.</p>
<p>The word &#8220;broadband&#8221; is nowhere to be found in the FTC&#8217;s planning document. Coming from an agency that says it wants to promote competition, that speaks volumes.</p>
<p>UPDATE: Geoff Cowan and David Westphal write that <a href="http://www.ojr.org/ojr/people/davidwestphal/200911/1801/">governments support journalism</a> to the tune of more than $1 billion a year, and note one particularly targeted form: legal advertising that goes to dominant print organizations. (They also claim that it&#8217;s a common myth that there&#8217;s no government support for media, but they don&#8217;t cite anyone of prominence who&#8217;s saying that.) They are all in favor of continuing government assistance, more so that I am, but at least they strongly urge that it remain content-neutral, something that I strongly doubt could happen if direct subsidies ever happen.</p>

America is getting ready to sharply escalate the war in Afghanistan. The health care system careens toward collapse, with legislation pending that may well make problems worse. The global economy may be in much worse shape than most people had imagined.</p>
<p>Yet what&#8217;s the Story of the Day? It&#8217;s the minor car accident of a celebrity golfer who &#8212; this makes &#8220;journalists&#8221; really angry &#8212; chooses to exercise his constitutional rights by not talking with the police until he&#8217;s good and ready, if ever.</p>
<p>Journalists bemoan the fact that the public doesn&#8217;t take them seriously anymore. Then they turn around and show why.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Michael Gerson, former chief speechwriter for George W. Bush and now one of the Washington Post&#8217;s assemblage of conservative columnists, bemoans today what his headline writer calls &#8220;<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/11/25/AR2009112503534.html?hpid=opinionsbox1">journalism&#8217;s slow, sad death</a>.&#8221; It&#8217;s yet another paean to the demise of monopoly/oligopoly media that, at its best, did perform occasional acts of public service. (Like so many pieces of its ilk, the column complains, among other things, that all those bloggers and other Internet news sites are living off the work of actual reporters; but the column contains no actual reporting other than a visit to a <a href="http://www.newseum.org/">museum</a> of journalism.) He writes:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Professional journalism is not like the buggy-whip industry, outdated by economic progress, to be mourned but not missed. This profession has a social value that is currently not reflected in its market value.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t economic progress, but technological progress, that did in the buggy-whip industry. Did anyone ever mourn it, much less miss it, other than the people it employed and the communities where they lived?</p>
<p>Journalism&#8217;s social value is real. But the social value of the journalism <em>business</em>? Of the professional class of journalists that rose to claim white-collar, insider status and abused it so royally?</p>
<p>I suspect that what Gerson really misses is the subservient lapdog the Washington press corps, with a few honorable <a href="http://www.mcclatchydc.com/">institutional exceptions</a>, became during the early part of this decade.  And what, for example, is the social value of his own newspaper&#8217;s continuing refusal to acknowledge, much less correct, <a href="http://mediactive.com/2009/10/24/washington-post-editorial-remains-uncorrected/">an egregious error</a> on the editorial page that employs him?</p>
<p>My disgust with American newspapers grows with every such woe-is-us piece. They complain and complain about what we&#8217;re losing, and howl at the moon over the flaws of what&#8217;s emerging, even as they so often fail at remotely living up to their own proclaimed standards.</p>
<p>In my last posting, &#8220;<a href="http://mediactive.com/2009/11/24/that-hallowed-standard-of-accuracy-oops/">That Hallowed Standard of Accuracy: Oops</a>&#8220;, I deconstructed, at perhaps tedious length, a column by a Tennessee editorial page editor, Tom Bohs, who got so many things wrong in a piece that briefly discussed me and my work. The errors included misspelling my name and the name of a university with which I was once affiliated, and those were emblematic of the pure sloppiness and incoherence of the overall piece.</p>
<p>My name and the university&#8217;s have been corrected in the online column. But there is not even a hint that anything was wrong before &#8212; a correction method that holds ethical transparency in contempt &#8211;and none of the other points was addressed.</p>
<p>What kind of standards do these news organizations have? They don&#8217;t seem close to the allegedly professional ones Bohs and Gerson claim for their craft&#8217;s traditional members.</p>
<p>For years I&#8217;ve argued that we need to keep the good things that newspapers and the (vanishingly few) good broadcast journalism outlets do in the course of their work. We do need good journalism, but it&#8217;s increasingly clear that we&#8217;ll have a lot of it from the new entrants in the digital media ecosystem.</p>
<p>As for the old guard, I&#8217;ve just about given up caring. Their organizations are committing slow-motion suicide. Maybe the people left in the business, apart from the few serious innovators, lack the imaginations and/or talent, or are so overworked by corporate bosses that they can&#8217;t even try. But I&#8217;m not sure anymore what we&#8217;d really lose if their organizations all died tomorrow.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>(UPDATE: <em>Since I posted this on Nov. 24, the two misspellings in the newspaper column discussed below have been corrected, without a hint (in the online version, anyway) that there was ever a mistake in the first place. The other inaccuracies and questionable information remain in place.)<br />
</em><br />
My heart goes out, at least a little, to Tom Bohs, editorial page editor of the <a href="http://www.jacksonsun.com/">Jackson Sun</a> in Tennessee. He is undoubtedly wishing he&#8217;d spent a little more time on a column he published this week.</p>
<p>His piece, entitled &#8220;<a href="http://www.jacksonsun.com/article/20091122/COLUMNISTS01/911220301">Citizen journalist, pick your beat.&#8221;</a> featured some standard, boilerplate stereotypes &#8212; such as people with mobile-phone cameras who contribute what they shoot to &#8220;real&#8221; media organizations like, uh, the Sun &#8212; with just the barest effort to acknowledge the enormous variety and in some cases quality of non-traditional offerings that are diversifying the media ecosystem. Overall, the column comes off as yet another semi-informed member of the old guard wishing he could turn back the clock. No big deal.</p>
<p>So why am I feeling some sympathy for Bohs? It&#8217;s because of his column&#8217;s final four paragraphs, which may well have earned him a spot in the Irony Hall of Fame, or at least the Media Criticism wing.</p>
<p>Bohs wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>To give you a little perspective, however, the guy who folks say invented modern citizen journalism is former San Jose Mercury News journalist Dan Gilmour. He was a technology columnist for the newspaper which operates deep in the heart of Silicon Valley. He allegedly wrote the first newspaper online blog. Then he wrote a book about citizen journalism titled &#8216;We the Media.&#8217; Then he got out of the news business. </em></p>
<p><em>I&#8217;m not sure what that means. Today, Gilmour runs an operation called the Center for Citizen Media at UC Berkely. I guess he figured with all these citizens running around doing his job, he needed to find a new line of work, teaching them to do his former job &#8211; for free. </em></p>
<p><em>As the news business continues to evolve at the mercy of technology, citizen journalism is going to play a major role. Here is a simple guideline to help you evaluate what you read on the blogs and forums, chats and tweets. It is a guideline old school journalists still live by: If your mother tells you she loves you, check it out. </em></p>
<p><em>I hope our new era of citizen journalists adopt the standard, as well.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Oh, my, where to begin&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li>I don&#8217;t know which folks say I invented modern citizen journalism. I&#8217;m not one of them. I&#8217;ve definitely been among the many people who&#8217;ve worked to help it happen, and to make it as good as possible for everyone involved.</li>
<li>My last name is spelled Gillmor, not Gilmour.</li>
<li>I &#8220;allegedly wrote the first newspaper online blog&#8221;? (Copy editors: All blogs are online.) Not sure what the &#8220;allegedly&#8221; is all about, except possibly to suggest some faint unseemliness or false claim. Who&#8217;s alleged to have said it, anyway? Mine may well have been the first blog by a daily newspaper journalist, but that&#8217;s all I&#8217;ll claim.</li>
<li>Aha, a true fact: I did write <em>We the Media</em>.</li>
<li>No, I didn&#8217;t then get out of the news business. I started what turned out to be an ill-fated Bay Area news site, Bayosphere, which was definitely part of the news business. I started the Center for Citizen Media (see below for current status), one of the purposes of which was to help extend the news business. I&#8217;ve invested in and/or advised a number of enterprises &#8212; some for-profit and some not-for-profit &#8212; that have been deeply involved in the news and information sphere. I&#8217;ve been a paid speaker or consultant for several newspaper companies, and wrote occasional columns for the Financial Times (which I trust Bohs will concede is part of the real News Business) and still contribute periodically to other publications. My current position at Arizona State University is all about the news business: working with students studying journalism, business and other disciplines to help them create what we hope will be some of tomorrow&#8217;s lasting local-information enterprises. I&#8217;m more in the news business than I ever was as a columnist for a California newspaper.</li>
<li>The Center for Citizen Media still exists, but is mostly dormant at this point. It was affiliated with the University of California, Berkeley (that&#8217;s Berkeley with an &#8220;e&#8221; between the &#8220;l&#8221; and &#8220;y&#8221;), as well as Harvard University&#8217;s Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society, and is now affiliated with Arizona State. I haven&#8217;t been affiliated in any way with UC Berkeley for almost two years at this point, though I&#8217;m still fond of my former colleagues and students.</li>
<li>At no point in my work on citizen journalism have I pitched it as a replacement for traditional journalism. From the beginning I&#8217;ve said it would be a great addition, in its myriad forms, to the ecosystem, and competitive only in some spaces. I&#8217;ve also said, again and again in talks and in public writing, that while I hoped citizens would help traditional news organizations by participating in community journalism, I was and remain flatly opposed to business models that assume citizens are offering nothing but free labor for others to monetize.</li>
<li>Who&#8217;s running around doing my old job as a business and technology journalist? Lots of people, including traditional journalists and online-only creative types whose work has greatly increased the amount and in many cases the quality of tech information. Some bloggers are doing it for little or no money, for lots of reasons &#8212; they may be in the business; they may be building their brands; they may just love to cover a small niche &#8212; while other online journalists are making serious money at it, building important and well-funded new media organizations. The very last thing I figured when I co-taught a course at Berkeley was that I needed the job because citizen journalists had priced me out of the market. (When Bohs says &#8220;I guess&#8221;, that&#8217;s a point I won&#8217;t argue.)</li>
<li>The news business is clearly being affected by technology. It is not at the mercy of technology. Journalists will continue to do journalism, using the evolving tools of the trade in enterprises that adapt to change, long after newspapers have faded from the scene. The only news people at the utter mercy of technology are the ones who have given up on themselves.</li>
</ul>
<p>And now we come to Bohs&#8217; stern advice &#8212; preceded, to be fair, by an acknowledgment that citizen journalism is here to stay &#8212; to all those who need to decide what to make of what they find online. Follow the lead of the pros, he says: Don&#8217;t trust it unless you&#8217;ve checked it out.</p>
<p>Bohs could have checked out everything he said about me and got so absurdly wrong, even without picking up the phone and calling. He could have used that new-fangled Google thing, where typing in &#8220;Dan Gillmor&#8221; &#8212; or even &#8220;Dan Gilmour&#8221; &#8212; returns links to <a href="http://dangillmor.com">dangillmor.com</a> (the top one with the correct spelling, third on the list for the one Bohs used), where I lay out in some detail exactly what I&#8217;ve been doing for the past few years and am doing now, with links to the blogs where I&#8217;ve been saying what I actually believe about journalism and its future, not what other people may claim (or imagine) I&#8217;ve said. Even my Wikipedia entry, which has some small inaccuracies, has my current gig listed correctly.</p>
<p>This is why Bohs, who clearly cares about journalism, surely must have had a sinking feeling in his gut last night or this morning when he discovered his mistakes. I hope he&#8217;ll turn that into a renewed dedication to the principles in which he says he believes.</p>

Yes, there&#8217;s an element of cliche about it &#8212; running the show in Thanksgiving &#8212; but so what? If we can&#8217;t give thanks for (some of) the people who deserve it on our best holiday, when can we?</p>
<p>The best part of the program, at least from the <a href="http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/cnn.heroes/archive09/index.html">promos and articles</a> about the people being honored,  is that they&#8217;re &#8220;regular folks&#8221; doing out-of-the-ordinary things. (Military personnel seem to be ineligible for these awards, which is an odd omission, but the honorees are certainly impressive in their own right.) You can find instructions on the website on how to donate your own time and/or money to various causes championed by the honorees. All in all, CNN is doing something good for the world with this event.</p>
<p>But look again at this image. Who&#8217;s that towering over the honorees? Why, it&#8217;s Anderson Cooper, the host of the program. Apparently he and his network are the real heros.</p>
<p>Look, I know this is about promoting an event. And I  know that Cooper is the face people will recognize.</p>
<p>But the way this is framed tells the story of network &#8220;journalism&#8221; today &#8212; a celebrity-infused system that conflates news readers with the people they cover.</p>
<p>Anderson Cooper may well be a fine journalist. I can&#8217;t really say, as I&#8217;ve given up on CNN and the other U.S. &#8220;news&#8221; networks for anything but stenography for the rich and powerful, fluff and, occasionally, breaking news where the events tell their own stories.</p>
<p>If Cooper is a indeed good journalist, or even a respectable one, this image should make him cringe. And someday, sooner than later, he should say so out loud.</p>

		<p><img src="http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/cmlp-logo.jpg" alt="cmlp logo.jpg" border="0" width="74" height="83" align="left" hspace=5 />The <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu">Berkman</a> Center&#8217;s Citizen Media Law Project has launched the <a href="http://www.citmedialaw.org/blog/2009/citizen-media-law-project-launches-legal-assistance-network-online-journalists">Online Media Legal Network (OMLN)</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>a new pro bono initiative that connects lawyers and law school clinics from across the country with online journalists and digital media creators who need legal help. Lawyers participating in OMLN will provide qualifying online publishers with pro bono and reduced fee legal assistance on a broad range of legal issues, including business formation and governance, copyright licensing and fair use, employment and freelancer agreements, access to government information, pre-publication review of content, and representation in litigation.</p></blockquote>
<p></em><br />
This is a valuable initiative. It will help many more people than the individuals who receive assistance from volunteer lawyers and law students in specific cases.</p>
<p>One of the common misconceptions in digital media over the past few years has been the notion that bloggers may be somehow exempt from the laws that apply to other forms of publishing. Nothing could be further from the truth.</p>
<p>The laws aren&#8217;t only about defamation, though that&#8217;s where the biggest threats to independent journalists can be found &#8212; in part because the independents don&#8217;t have legal teams at their disposal. Some plaintiffs have sued or threatened to sue largely to shut down criticism, not because they&#8217;ve actually been defamed, and just the threat of a lawsuit is often enough to shut down legitimate speech.</p>
<p>There are lots of other legal issues you need to think about if you publish on the Web, including fair use, freelance agreements, setting up businesses and the like. The new network will help with those issues, too, among others.</p>
<p>The CMLP has lined up an impressive <a href="http://www.omln.org/lawyers">collection of lawyers and law clinics</a> for this initiative. They all deserve thanks as well.</p>
<p><em>(Note: I&#8217;m a CMLP <a href="http://www.citmedialaw.org/about/founders">co-founder and advisor</a>.)</em></p>
