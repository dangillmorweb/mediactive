		<p><img style="float: right;" src="http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Andrew-Alexander-photo.png" border="0" alt="Andrew Alexander photo.png" width="81" height="81" />Andrew Alexander, the Washington Post&#8217;s ombudsman for the past two years, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/linkset/2009/02/25/LI2009022502075.html">signs off today</a> in a column that expresses great admiration for the institution he has served—and frustration at its failures, which add up to what readers and he agreed he has been a drop in quality. He writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;ve written before that <a style="text-decoration: underline; color: #0c4790;" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/06/12/AR2009061203017.html">The Post on its worst days</a> is better than most newspapers on their best days. In print and online, it retains immense influence through journalism that can frame public discourse. And it still produces stunningly ambitious work, such as last year&#8217;s &#8220;<a style="text-decoration: underline; color: #0c4790;" href="http://projects.washingtonpost.com/top-secret-america/">Top Secret America</a>&#8221; project on the huge national security buildup and the &#8220;<a style="text-decoration: underline; color: #0c4790;" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/nation/guns/">Hidden Life of Guns</a>&#8221; series tracking firearms used in crimes. Priced lower than most competitors, the newspaper is a bargain.</p>
<p>But it has become riddled with typos, grammatical mistakes and intolerable &#8220;small&#8221; factual errors that erode credibility. Local news coverage, once robust, has withered. The Post often trails the competition on stories. The excessive use of <a style="text-decoration: underline; color: #0c4790;" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/12/17/AR2010121704658.html">anonymous sources</a> has expanded into blogs. The once-broken system for publishing corrections has been repaired, but corrections often still take too long to appear. The list goes on.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s obvious that the Post newsroom, on all too many occasions, has either paid insufficient attention to his advice or has ignored it entirely. Perhaps that&#8217;s unsurprising. Ombudsmen are never popular inside the organizations they serve, because their job is to hold the insiders accountable.</p>
<p>And never mind the newspaper&#8217;s editorial pages, the quality of which has plummeted in recent years. The edit pages have never been part of Alexander&#8217;s purview, but they need a reader&#8217;s representative vastly more than the news pages, which, as Alexander notes, are still more than capable of doing extraordinarily important journalism.</p>
<p>I had several encounters with Alexander during his tenure. He has been unfailingly gracious, even when we have disagreed on several issues, and when he quoted me he did so accurately and in context—something I cannot say happens consistently..</p>
<p>The ombudsman job at the Washington Post is almost entirely thankless. I can&#8217;t imagine why anyone would want it. Alexander Alexander deserves credit for his tenure.</p>

		<p><em>UPDATE Jan. 22, 2012</em></p>
<p><em>(Much of this article was originally <a href="http://www.salon.com/technology/dan_gillmor/2011/01/08/arizona_shootings_slow_news/index.html" target="_blank">published</a> on Salon.com on January 8, 2011, and that article was modified from <a href="http://mediactive.com/2-7-toward-a-slower-news-culture/">this section</a> in Mediactive.).</em></p>
<p>Joe Paterno died. No, he didn&#8217;t. (Ultimately, yes <a href="http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/46085007/ns/sports-college_football/">he did</a>.)</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/regret-the-error/160277/false-paterno-death-reports-highlight-journalists-hunger-for-glory/">false reports</a> of his death are yet another case of shoot-first, aim-later journalism. It&#8217;s not a new phenomenon in the Digital Age, but the way news moves now makes it a more significant problem.</p>
<p><strong>We need to wait for facts in fast-breaking news events; jumping to conclusions doesn&#8217;t help.</strong></p>
<p>Think back just a year, to the memorable events in Tuscon, Arizona.<em><br />
</em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2871" title="npr_giffords_killed" src="http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/npr_giffords_killed.png" alt="NPR Mistakenly Reports Giffords Killed" width="428" height="121" srcset="http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/npr_giffords_killed.png 428w, http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/npr_giffords_killed-300x84.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 428px) 100vw, 428px" />Like so many other people today, I&#8217;ve been following the news about <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/09/us/politics/09giffords.html?_r=1&amp;hp" target="_blank">horrific events</a> in Tucson, Ariz., where Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, a Democrat, is one of a number of shooting victims. As I write this, it&#8217;s not known how many have died. And as I write this, news reports say that Giffords is in surgery, in critical condition.</p>
<p>The reports from traditional news organizations, amplified by Twitter, blogs and other Internet media, have been a parade of unclear information &#8212; just what we&#8217;ve come to expect in such situations. CNN&#8217;s headline now reads &#8220;Congresswoman Giffords shot&#8221; &#8212; with a sub-headline saying, &#8220;There are conflicting reports on whether she has died.&#8221; No kidding: One of those conflicting reports was CNN&#8217;s own report, citing an unnamed sources, that Giffords had died. (UPDATE: See Regret the Error&#8217;s Craig Silverman&#8217;s <a href="http://www.regrettheerror.com/2011/01/08/npr-reuters-cnn-and-other-major-news-orgs-incorrectly-declare-death-of-rep-giffords/" target="_blank">exhaustive compilation</a> of Big Media misstatements, from which I grabbed the above screenshot of NPR&#8217;s mis-reporting of Giffords&#8217; condition.)</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Levi Sumagaysay, who writes <a href="http://blogs.siliconvalley.com/gmsv/">Good Morning Silicon Valley</a>, the long-running tech blog of the San Jose Mercury News, interviewed me about the book and the project. Here&#8217;s an excerpt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>GMSV</strong>: You write in Mediactive: “There’s no conflict between having a world view and doing great journalism.” Do you think people understand that? Or has the myth been pounded into their heads that there needs to be two “balanced” sides in every story?</p>
<p><strong>Gillmor</strong>: I hope that we’re making progress toward the reality that it’s not balanced to give equal weight to two sides when one side is lying. People understand that’s not the way the world is, that that’s just bogus. [But I see more] journalists pointing out outright lies. It’s hard for them to do it, but it’s a good thing. They don’t want to be regarded as partisan. I’d rather be falsely called a partisan than correctly called a dupe.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Read the <a href="http://blogs.siliconvalley.com/gmsv/2011/01/q-a-with-dan-gillmor-author-and-journalist.html">full interview here</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Boston Phoenix blog features a crossposting of a long Q&amp;A I did with former Phoenix media critic Dan Kennedy, a professor of journalism at Boston University, at his Media Nation site. Dan generously advises:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Y]ou should all read &#8220;Mediactive.&#8221; It&#8217;s edgier and less optimistic than &#8220;We the Media,&#8221; but Gillmor has lost none of his passion for urging readers, viewers and listeners &#8211; the &#8220;former audience,&#8221; as Gillmor dubbed them in his first book &#8211; to get up off their seats and demand that the media be held accountable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here&#8217;s a <a href="http://thephoenix.com/BLOGS/phlog/archive/2011/01/21/dan-gillmor-on-how-to-make-the-media-serve-us.aspx">link to the Phoenix piece</a>, and to <a href="http://www.dankennedy.net/2011/01/19/dan-gillmor-on-how-to-make-the-media-serve-us/">Dan&#8217;s original Media Nation posting</a>.</p>
<p>Many thanks to both Dan and Levi.</p>

New York Times blogger Stanley Fish has given a <a style="border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-left-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 13px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; color: #cc0000; text-decoration: none; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: #cccccc; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;" href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/03/anonymity-and-the-dark-side-of-the-internet/?ref=opinion" target="_blank">glowing endorsement</a> to a new <a style="border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-left-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 13px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; color: #cc0000; text-decoration: none; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: #cccccc; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;" href="http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674050891" target="_blank">book</a> of essays in which law professors &#8212; &#8212; who profess to believe in free speech &#8212; call for the curtailment of online anonymity.</p>
<p>Their hearts are in the right place. Parts of the Internet are cesspools of slimy speech, where anonymous cowards hide behind virtual bushes and say outrageous, untrue things about others. I&#8217;ve been attacked in this way, and I don&#8217;t like it.</p>
<p>So of course anyone with a conscience wants to encourage accountability and responsibility in speech. But the key word there is &#8220;encourage,&#8221; not &#8220;force.&#8221; It&#8217;s essential to preserve anonymity, and to appreciate why it’s vital. Anonymity protects whistle-blowers and others for whom speech can be unfairly dangerous.</p>
<p>If Fish&#8217;s description of the book is accurate, the authors are offering a cure that is much more dangerous than the disease: They would require Internet sites to take legal responsibility for what other people post on their sites.</p>
<p>Worse, they pay too little attention to the people who can do most to solve this problem. Who are those people? Us, you and me, who are the audiences for speech. <em>We</em> are the ones who need to take more responsibility. I&#8217;ll come back to this, but first let&#8217;s understand why the authors&#8217; fix would stifle online speech in dangerous ways.</p>
<p>Fish writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Internet and the real world, [essayist Brian] Leiter concludes, &#8220;would both be better places&#8221; if Internet providers were held accountable for the scurrilous and harmful material they disseminate.</p>
<p>How might that be managed? The answer given by the authors in this volume involves the repeal or modification of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which says that no provider of an Internet service shall be treated as the publisher of information provided by another. That is, the provider is not liable for what others have said, and courts have interpreted that section as immunizing providers even when they “have knowledge that [a statement] is defamatory or invasive of privacy.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Modifying Section 230 is risky business. This law has done more to encourage robust speech, by far, than any other piece of legislation in recent history. The immunity rests with the host. It does not extend to the person who posted the defamatory material. And courts have routinely required hosts to turn over information &#8212; such as IP addresses &#8212; about people who&#8217;ve posted defamatory material, while also generally resisting fishing expeditions by parties, especially companies, that want to shut down harsh but non-defamatory criticism.</p>
<p>If the law required Internet sites to monitor and control the speech they hosted, all kinds of conversations &#8212; mail lists, forums, comment threads and more &#8212; would simply disappear. The legal exposure for hosts would simply be too great for most people or companies to take the chance; being sued, even if you&#8217;re entirely in the right, can be ruinous financially.</p>
<p>What we need to modify most is our own attitudes.</p>
<p>This should start with the way we treat a kind of anonymous speech that I consider vastly more pernicious than the crapola I see on random blogs and comment threads: the too-common use of anonymity in Big Media reporting. As I&#8217;ve written in my new book, <a style="border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-left-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 13px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; color: #cc0000; text-decoration: none; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: #cccccc; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;" href="http://mediactive.com/book" target="_blank">&#8220;Mediactive,&#8221;</a> I have a rule of thumb. When a news report quotes anonymous sources, I immediately question the entire thing. I’m skeptical enough about spin from people who stand behind their own words, but downright cynical about the people who use journalist-granted anonymity to push a position or, worse, slam someone else. When someone hides behind anonymity to attack someone else this way, you shouldn’t just ignore it.<em>In the absence of actual evidence, you should actively disbelieve it.</em> And you should hold the journalist who reports it in contempt for being the conduit.</p>
<p>I have even less respect, if that&#8217;s possible, for most online comment threads. Anonymous commenters on blogs or news articles deserve less than no credibility on any BS meter. They&#8217;d have to work hard just to have zero credibility.</p>
<p><a style="border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-left-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 13px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; color: #cc0000; text-decoration: none; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: #cccccc; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudonym" target="_blank">Pseudonyms</a> are a more interesting case, and can have value. Done right, they can bring greater accountability and therefore somewhat more credibility than anonymous comments. Content-management systems have mechanisms designed to require some light-touch registration, even if it’s merely having a working e-mail address, and to prevent more than one person from using the same pseudonym on a given site. A pseudonym isn’t as useful as a real name, but it does encourage somewhat better behavior, in part because it’s more accountable. A pseudonymous commenter who builds a track record of worthwhile conversation, moreover, can build personal credibility even without revealing his or her real name (though I believe using real names is almost always better).</p>
<p>Conveners of online conversations need to provide better tools for the people having the conversations. These include moderation systems that actually help bring the best commentary to the surface, ways for readers to avoid the postings of people they find offensive and community-driven methods of identifying and banning abusers.</p>
<p>Again, while recognizing the real problem of anonymous sleaze, I emphasize again that it&#8217;s vital to preserve anonymity while encouraging its responsible use. And it&#8217;s even more vital for us to put anonymous attacks in their place: the virtual garbage pits where they belong. Only we can do that.</p>
<p>So when people don’t stand behind their words, we should always wonder why &#8212; and make appropriate adjustments in how we react to what they say.</p>

<p><strong>A partisan vote on Tuesday displeases everyone. And everyone&#8217;s right</strong></p>
<p>The neutering of the Internet is now the unofficial policy of the Federal Communications Commission. Contrary to the happy talk from FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski at a <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2010/TECH/web/12/21/fcc.net.neutrality/" target="_blank">rule-making announcement</a> today in Washington, the move is well underway to turn the Internet into a regulated playground for corporate giants.</p>
<p>Tuesday&#8217;s FCC vote on rules purportedly designed to ensure open and free networks was a 3-2 partisan charade, with Genachowski and the other two Democratic commissioners in favor and the two Republicans against. It did nothing of the sort. The short-term result will be confusion and jockeying for position. Genachowski&#8217;s claim that the rules bring &#8220;a level of certainty&#8221; to the landscape was laughable unless he was talking about lobbyists and lawyers; their futures are certainly looking prosperous. The longer-range result will be to solidify the power of the incumbent powerhouses &#8212; especially telecommunications providers and the entertainment industry &#8212; to take much more control over what we do online.</p>

<p><strong>Survey: The public gets that most political ads are bogus, but people still believe things that are false</strong></p>
<p>A new study about media misinformation and media users&#8217; ignorance is only the latest wakeup call for anyone who worries that the American press has gone badly astray. From the summary of <a href="http://www.worldpublicopinion.org/pipa/articles/brunitedstatescanadara/671.php?nid=&amp;id=&amp;pnt=671&amp;lb=" target="_blank">&#8220;Misinformation and the 2010 Election&#8221;</a> comes this bottom line:</p>
<ul>
<li>The public is thoroughly cynical about political campaign advertising.</li>
<li>Much of the public is misinformed about major issues.</li>
<li>Fox News viewers are especially prone to believing things that are not true.</li>
</ul>
<p>The report, from the Program on International Policy Attitudes at the University of Maryland, won&#8217;t surprise anyone who&#8217;s been paying attention to national affairs and the media. We have an information crisis. Influence peddlers and opinion launderers can now spend unlimited amounts of money, much of it raised from anonymous sources, to push political issues and candidates. A system that has absolutely no accountability is almost guaranteed to become a sewer, and this one certainly has.</p>

<p><strong>Unfortunately, they&#8217;re not American journalists</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s heartening to see some journalists standing up for principle in the <a href="http://www.salon.com/news/wikileaks/index.html">WikiLeaks affair</a>. A case in point is this <a href="http://www.walkleys.com/news/1076/" target="_blank">letter to Australian Prime Minister</a> Julia Gillard. It begins:</p>
<blockquote><p>The leaking of 250,000 confidential American diplomatic cables is the most astonishing leak of official information in recent history, and its full implications are yet to emerge. But some things are clear. In essence, WikiLeaks, an organisation that aims to expose official secrets, is doing what the media have always done: bringing to light material that governments would prefer to keep secret.</p>
<p>In this case, WikiLeaks, founded by Australian Julian Assange, worked with five major newspapers around the world, which published and analysed the embassy cables. Diplomatic correspondence relating to Australia has begun to be published here.</p>
<p>The volume of the leaks is unprecedented, yet the leaking and publication of diplomatic correspondence is not new. We, as editors and news directors of major media organisations, believe the reaction of the US and Australian governments to date has been deeply troubling. We will strongly resist any attempts to make the publication of these or similar documents illegal. Any such action would impact not only on WikiLeaks, but every media organisation in the world that aims to inform the public about decisions made on their behalf. WikiLeaks, just four years old, is part of the media and deserves our support.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>By defending the organization as media, which we should, we may invite some unwanted consequences</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/#!/dangillmor" target="_blank">Twitter</a> may be the worst medium around for nuance, but a series of 140-character messages can at least clarify a disagreement.

<p>One conversation was with a journalist friend, <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/jason_pontin" target="_blank">Jason Pontin</a>, editor of the MIT <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/" target="_blank">Technology Review</a>. Like many people, he&#8217;s not thrilled with all of what Julian Assange and his WikiLeaks team are doing.
