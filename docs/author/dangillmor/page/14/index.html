		<p><em>This article was <a href="http://www.salon.com/technology/dan_gillmor/2010/07/10/football_s_foolish_stadium_rules/index.html" target="_blank">originally published</a> on Salon on July 10, 2010.</em></p>
<h3>Soccer officials and their foolish rules, trying to restrict what fans can say from inside the stadium</h3>
<p>In the technology whack-a-mole sweepstakes, please meet this month&#8217;s winner: <a href="http://www.fifa.com/" target="_blank">FIFA</a>, the cartel that operates the World Cup. The organization actually appears to believe it can stop fans attending the games from telling people outside the stadium what&#8217;s going on inside, at least in any timely way.</p>
<p>Allow me to quote from the <a href="http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/organisation/ticketing/stadiumcodeofconduct.html" target="_blank">Stadium Code of Conduct</a>, which prohibits fans from bringing into the stadium (unless perviously authorized) a long, long list of items including:</p>
<blockquote><p>p) cameras (except for private use and then only with one set of replacement or rechargeable batteries), video cameras or other sound or video recording equipment;</p>
<p>q) computers or other devices used for the purposes of transmitting or disseminating sound, pictures, descriptions or results of the events via the internet or other forms of media&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>Skip down a bit and you find another long list of prohibited actions once inside the stadium. The relevant one here says one may not:</p>
<blockquote><p>record (except for private purposes), transmit, or in any other manner disseminate over the internet or any other media, including mobile devices, any sound, image, description, or result of any event taking place within the Stadium, in whole or in part, or assist any other person(s) conducting such activities; commercially exploit any photographs or images taken within the Stadium&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>FIFA&#8217;s motives aren&#8217;t mysterious. Like all professional entertainment organizations &#8212; and pro sports is nothing but an entertainment business when you come down to it &#8212; the organizers want to control who&#8217;s going to make money off at least the immediate event, if not every ancillary piece. But FIFA&#8217;s rules, like so many others, are unsustainable.</p>
<p>﻿In an hour or so, I&#8217;ll be heading to the consolation game of the 2010 World Cup in Port Elizabeth, South Africa, with a group of journalism educators from around the world. (The <a href="http://wjec.ru.ac.za/news/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=27&amp;Itemid=30&amp;lang=en" target="_blank">sponsors</a> of a conference where I spoke have helped pay my expenses, including a ticket to the game.) I&#8217;m not sure whether I&#8217;ll commit one of the prohibited actions, but I&#8217;ll definitely be violating the rules of what I can bring inside. And, of course, I&#8217;ll be one of the tens of thousands of people there who does so.</p>
<p>This is because, as FIFA knows perfectly well, most of us &#8212; surely a majority of those attending a World Cup game &#8212; carries a video camera and sound recording device at all times, as well as a computer. It&#8217;s called a mobile phone. If it&#8217;s a so-called smart phone, it&#8217;s capable of everything FIFA and other big sports cartels, such as the International Olympic Committee, have no real idea how to handle in an ecosystem they want to control so completely but which is opening up despite their wishes. (The Olympics officials made themselves look truly idiotic earlier this year with their attempts to restrict even what <a href="http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2010/02/athletes-confused-by-olympic-social-media-rules/" target="_blank">athletes could say</a>.)</p>
<p>They can discover the pro-quality, high-definition video cameras with zoom lenses and the works, and keep that gear out. But some newer mobile devices are getting pretty slick in their video capabilities, and hidden cameras, for better or worse, are getting much, much more capable and simple to disguise. In a few years it&#8217;ll be trivially easily to disguise even a HD video recorder in, for example, buttons or caps. What will FIFA and similar organizations do then?</p>
<p>Rather than try to restrict the use of these devices, FIFA would be wise to encourage them. I&#8217;m not urging them to invite people to bring in fancy video gear with super-resolution close-up capabilities (yet, anyway). But to suggest that people should not be allowed to send an SMS to a friend after a goal is scored is lunatic even for the most control-freakish outfits.</p>
<p>In fact, if I were running FIFA&#8217;s communications/media operation, I&#8217;d invite people to be posting videos wherever they wished, and would do my best to aggregate the best ones as quickly as possible. I&#8217;d invite the global Internet audience to piece together whatever looked the most interesting videos in any way they chose, and then invite those folks to tell us where to find them so we could promote the best ones.</p>
<p>Will there be a time when fan-TV in real time is good enough to be good enough for the people who pay for TV service that advertisers sponsor at huge costs? Eventually, perhaps. But not right away, and there&#8217;s plenty of time for live-entertainment industries to figure out rational new rules.</p>
<p>Real-time social media should be a boon to big-time entertainment, including sports. I wonder if the official bodies that run them will recognize that soon enough.</p>

<h3>Android software update turns Internet access loss into a minor problem</h3>
<p>As <a href="http://www.salon.com/technology/dan_gillmor/2010/07/06/yes_technology_fails_sometimes/index.html">noted</a> several days ago, problems in an intercontinental fiber-optic cable have caused Internet outages for a lot of folks in South Africa this week. Those of us attending the <a href="http://highwayafrica.com/" target="_blank">Highway Africa</a> and <a href="http://wjec.ru.ac.za/" target="_blank">World Journalism Education Congress</a> meetings were among the mostly disconnected.</p>
<p>But not completely in my case, due to a truly nifty feature in the latest version of its <a href="http://www.android.com/" target="_blank">Android</a> mobile operating system: The phone becomes a Wi-Fi hotspot. It&#8217;s simply a matter of going to the Settings and turning it on.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d already bought a local SIM card and a voice/data plan &#8212; total cost about $75 for ample voice time plus 2 gigabytes of data &#8212; for the two weeks we were scheduled to be in the country. I didn&#8217;t want to pay the outrageous Internet charges hotels tend to charge in much of the world, and also knew we&#8217;d be visiting some non-urban areas; the mobile networks do a comprehensive job of covering the country, and in a pinch, I figured, this would suffice. The pinch became a crunch with the cable failure, making the investment an even better one than I&#8217;d anticipated.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not new to convert a mobile phone to a modem via tethering. I&#8217;d done that before with several other phones. Turning it into a hotspot was more difficult. With this feature, Google has added a service that users will relish &#8212; but which some mobile carriers will loathe, because the need for expensive extra dongles and data plans just went away in many cases. Some carriers seem to be <a href="http://www.droidforums.net/forum/droid-hacks/56396-no-portable-hotspot-option-frf84b.html" target="_blank">preempting this feature</a>, it seems, just for that reason. (It&#8217;s possible to unlock these and other &#8220;prohibited&#8221; features, though it takes some work, which I&#8217;ll describe in another posting one of these days.)</p>
<p>My U.S. mobile carrier charges a data fee for the phone, and with a bandwidth cap of (I believe) about 5 GB per month. It doesn&#8217;t care, as far as I can tell, whether I use it with the phone alone or a phone/computer combination. This is the right approach, but some carriers want you to<a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/06/02/atandt-makes-sweeping-changes-to-data-plans-iphone-tethering-comi/" target="_blank">pay more just for the convenience</a> of tethering your laptop to the phone.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the latest Android OS isn&#8217;t available yet on many of the Android phones. (And the word is it won&#8217;t work, ever, on some older phones like the ones, such as the G1s.) So if you have one of those, you&#8217;ll just have to wait until your carrier decides to a) install the upgrade; and b) enable the hotspot.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><em>This article was <a href="http://www.salon.com/technology/dan_gillmor/2010/07/07/free_as_in_lemonade/index.html" target="_blank">originally published</a> on Salon on July 7, 2010.</em></p>
<h2>In which a newspaper columnist attacks little girls for the anti-American act of giving away lemonade. Really</h2>
<p>Sometimes you can&#8217;t tell if someone is pulling your leg or being serious. So for a few minutes after I read <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/business/savage/2464546,CST-NWS-savage05.savagearticle" target="_blank">this column</a> from the Chicago Sun-Times I was sure it was a gag, but then I realized it was published on July 5 and not April 1.</p>
<p>To sum it up: The writer, Terry Savage, got all exercised because three girls in an upscale suburb had set up a lemonade stand but were <em>giving it away</em> instead of demanding payment. Here is my favorite part of the rant, in which the kids are instructed:</p>
<blockquote><p>You must charge something for the lemonade. That&#8217;s the whole point of a lemonade stand. You figure out your costs &#8212; how much the lemonade costs, and the cups &#8212; and then you charge a little more than what it costs you, so you can make money. Then you can buy more stuff, and make more lemonade, and sell it and make more money.</p></blockquote>
<p>But wasn&#8217;t this really about the spirit of giving, as another person suggested? Savage insisted:</p>
<blockquote><p>That&#8217;s not the spirit of giving. You can only really give when you give something you own. They&#8217;re giving away their parents&#8217; things &#8212; the lemonade, cups, candy. It&#8217;s not theirs to give.﻿</p></blockquote>
<p>Uh &#8230; Let&#8217;s follow the &#8220;logic&#8221; of the second quote just a bit, then return to the first. The girls did own what they were giving away: It had already been given to them by their parents. Surely that&#8217;s as easy for the kids (and maybe Savage) to understand as any mercantile notions, no?</p>
<p>The idea, more important, that the parents needed to teach them to approach this endeavor in mercantile ways &#8212; or, I guess, be scarred forever ﻿as incomplete capitalists &#8212; is laugh-out-loud loony. Voluntarism, and doing good deeds, are as American (or used to be) as getting rich.</p>
<p>Savage did have a reasonable point spinning off the initial premise:</p>
<blockquote><p>America is getting it all wrong when it comes to government, and taxes, and policy. We all act as if the &#8220;lemonade&#8221; or benefits we&#8217;re &#8220;giving away&#8221; is free.</p>
<p>And so the voters demand more &#8212; more subsidies for mortgages, more bailouts, more loan modification and longer periods of unemployment benefits.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re all very nice. But these things aren&#8217;t free.</p></blockquote>
<p>No, they aren&#8217;t. And it&#8217;s clear enough that our national sense of entitlement has led us into the worst kind of trouble. Someday, maybe soon, the reckoning will arrive, and when it does America&#8217;s grotesque debts will come due. My generation has stolen so much of the future from our kids and generations to come that we should be ashamed.</p>
<p>But we learned to steal from experts &#8212; especially from people like the Wall Street gang whose financial &#8220;innovations&#8221; were new kinds of paper that were only one step removed from the counterfeiters of yore, and apparently legal only because several generations of politicians were paid to make it so. Successive Congresses and presidents, except for a few years during the Clinton administration, spent our kids&#8217; money with epic irresponsibility.</p>
<p>We learned to steal from the people who raided the treasury for billions<em>in cash</em> that went missing in Iraq after the United States invaded. We learned from the epic corporate welfare of recent years, such as the telecom industry, which got exclusive use of our airwaves and street rights-of-way and then sold it back to us. As Cory Doctorow <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2010/07/07/finance-columnist-ex.html" target="_blank">notes</a>, in a different but fun take on the lemonade scandal:</p>
<blockquote><p>Get that, kids? The correct thing to do with the stuff you appropriate from others is sell it, not give it away! Sounds about right &#8212; companies take over our public aquifers and sell us the water they pump out of them; telcos get our rights of way for their infrastructure, then insist that they be able to tier their pricing without regard to the public interest. Corporatism in a nutshell, really.</p></blockquote>
<p>But, yes, let&#8217;s face it: We also learned to steal from each other as so many Americans demanded services we were totally unwilling to pay for. Some in the Tea Party crowd are hilariously hypocritical when they demand that government keep its hands off Medicare, but even before the economy went south we were collectively demanding that government (at all levels) spend or promise to spend money that could not possibly be repaid without higher taxes, which we then insist are off the table as even a possibility.</p>
<p>What America does need to do is recover our senses about responsibility. It will take a generation of investment and sacrifice, starting, one hopes, with the people whose corruption created the mess we&#8217;re in today, especially Wall Street and our political class, but also everyone else who&#8217;s been spending the next generation&#8217;s money so freely.</p>
<p>The investments won&#8217;t come only from the taxpayers, though we have enormous challenges we can only handle with national decisions. Shared sacrifice will mean a restored sense of voluntarism and civic duty.</p>
<p>People volunteer their services all the time, not looking for payment (ever heard of the barn-raising or a volunteer fire department in a small town, for example?). The &#8220;business model&#8221; for community theater is to enrich a community&#8217;s cultural life, and to give amateur actors a way to go onstage and fulfill something in their own lives. Maybe &#8220;free lemonade&#8221; that quenches some thirst and makes three girls happy has community-enrichment value, too.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll need to learn more from the open-source and free-software folks, who produce often  valuable work without direct payment to themselves. Some are making a living off it by providing ancillary services. Others do it because they believe in the principle. They may or may not love capitalism as it&#8217;s practiced today, but they do believe in contributing a piece of their lives to a larger cause. (The title of this post is a riff on an often-cited line about the difference between free and open-source software, as seen <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html" target="_blank">by Richard Stallman</a>: Free as in free<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">dom</span> speech, not as in beer.) (Thanks, whitenoise&#8230;)</p>
<p>I sense a latent but real understanding of what&#8217;s needed among the American public, which is waiting for a leader to ask the best of ourselves. Sadly we don&#8217;t have leaders like that.</p>

		<p><em>This article was <a href="http://www.salon.com/technology/dan_gillmor/2010/07/06/yes_technology_fails_sometimes/index.html" target="_blank">originally published</a> on Salon on July 6, 2010.</em></p>
<h2>Technology&#8217;s points of failure &#8212; and control &#8212; remain a constant worry even in the Internet Age</h2>
<p>The <a href="http://www.seacom.mu/" target="_blank">SEACOM</a> fiber-optic cable is one of the major data conduits connecting Africa&#8217;s networks to the rest of the world. SEACOM has suffered a serious outage in the past 36 hours or so, and Internet users across a wide area are having problems as a result. Among those affected are the South African universities that use a SEACOM-reliant regional research networking service, TENET, which also means that I and about 800 or so other participants at a pair of international <a href="http://highwayafrica.com/" target="_blank">media</a><a href="http://wjec.ru.ac.za/" target="_blank">conferences</a> in South Africa are mostly disconnected from email and the other Internet services we normally find essential.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to grumble in such situations, and we&#8217;re all doing that. And it&#8217;s essential that we work on ways to increase network reliability &#8212; and reduce our vulnerability to situations where a single point of failure can paralyze vital services.</p>
<p>Even as we realize how far we have to go before we can fully trust that when our online tools will be available when we need them, we need to remember how far we&#8217;ve come. A decade ago, on my first trip to Africa, dial-up phone access was the main way I connected to the Internet in my travels &#8212; if I could connect at all. And just decade before that, hardly anyone in America, much less Africa, had even heard of the Internet.</p>
<p>The problem we&#8217;re experiencing here will pass. Repairs to SEACOM are <a href="http://www.tenet.ac.za/gen3-service-information/major-incidents/seacom-outage-5-july-2010/" target="_blank">under way</a> (though conferees may not be back online properly by the time we leave two days from now). And Africa&#8217;s telecommunications system, while far behind the rest of the world, is steadily improving in a general sense.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I&#8217;m sending this column via the somewhat iffy WiFi connection at the B&amp;B where we&#8217;re staying. The establishment subscribes to an Internet service provider (ISP) that either doesn&#8217;t depend, down the pipe, on SEACOM or, unlike the university system, has found a way around the affected cables via other fiber-optic lines.</p>
<p>Yet the outage here reminds us that our interconnected world &#8212; and the technology we&#8217;ve increasingly come to rely on &#8212; remains all too vulnerable to areas of control that amount to outright choke points. Accidents or deliberate actions can achieve the same result: Network services go down or are censored; market-dominating software and Internet companies have critical bugs or use their power to make unilateral decisions.</p>
<p>Sometimes our problems are of our own making. Big Internet customers typically have backup plans for network outages. Home users typically don&#8217;t. This is one reason why the epic consolidation of the ISP business in much of the world, including the United States, into duopolies or oligopoly is a dangerous trend. When Comcast or AT&amp;T has a major outage, millions of people are stuck until service is restored. And the internet &#8220;backbone&#8221; system &#8212; the lines that carry the longer-distance traffic &#8212; is becoming more and more a fiefdom of a few big players.</p>
<p>Choke points are built into other parts of our culture and economy. We encourage single companies to control access to life-saving drugs. We have an energy ecosystem, especially the electrical grid, that&#8217;s scarily vulnerable to disruption. We invite huge financial institutions to make wild bets with other people&#8217;s money, grow too big to fail without bringing down the global economy, and then let them steal the rest of us blind when their insane bets go bad. A few thunderstorms in the wrong places create absolute havoc in airline traffic, in part due to an aging and nearly archaic Air Traffic Control system. Even a mild pandemic of a slightly more lethal virus than last year&#8217;s H1N1 would overwhelm our already-stretched hospitals. And so on.</p>
<p>The best solutions are redundancy and competition, of course. But there seems little political will to make the kinds of decisions that would encourage more of either. A rare exception was last week&#8217;s Obama administration <a href="http://techdailydose.nationaljournal.com/2010/06/white-house-proposes-more-band.php" target="_blank">proposal to expand wireless</a> bandwidth; we&#8217;ll see if the telecom industry&#8217;s lobbyists find a way, as they always try, to scuttle any initiative that expands competition.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s not much individuals can do about the mega choke points except tell politicians that they care, and vote. But we have more choices about the control points that affect our daily lives.</p>
<p>This is why you should keep in mind that data you post online &#8212; in places like Flickr, YouTube, Google Mail, Yahoo, Facebook and so many others &#8212; is much more in their control than yours. Can you get your information out as easily as you put it in? Rarely. And if you&#8217;re using a small service that someday goes out of business, you might be entirely out of luck.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s also why you should be wary of doing business with companies that sell you gadgets or other technology and then insist that they, not you, have ultimate control over the ways you can use them. Apple is most famous for this kind of <a href="http://www.salon.com/technology/2010/06/07/apple_wwdc_control">control-freakery</a> in its iPhone/iPad ecosystem, but is hardly alone. You may recall that Amazon (a company in which I own a small amount of stock) drew well-deserved fury when, for reasons it considered compelling, it <a href="http://seattlest.com/2009/07/17/amazons_kindle--now_with_new_take-b.php" target="_blank">removed books</a> from customers&#8217; Kindles remotely. <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-30684_3-10345639-265.html" target="_blank">Apologies</a> don&#8217;t suffice; the way to avoid such gaffes is to be open and non-controlling.</p>
<p>And the way for the rest of us to avoid being on the receiving end is to have a Plan B for the essentials. Do you?</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><em>This article was </em><a href="http://www.salon.com/technology/dan_gillmor/2010/07/04/an_independent_press/index.html" target="_blank"><em>originally published</em></a><em> on Salon on July 4, 2010.</em></p>
<h2>On Independence Day, noting that the truly independent American journalists don&#8217;t work for big organizations</h2>
<p>GRAHAMSTOWN, South Africa &#8212; Journalists tend to take themselves too seriously, and their craft not seriously enough. So it is apt that some famous and obscure quotations and aphorisms about the value and function of a free press adorn the tiled walls of the restrooms at Rhodes University&#8217;s African Media Matrix &#8212; the building that houses what is widely considered the continent&#8217;s top journalism school.</p>
<p>One of those quotes is from Nelson Mandela, <a href="http://allafrica.com/stories/200206170312.html" target="_blank">spoken</a> in 2002, and it feels dismayingly correct today:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“A bad free press is preferable to a technically good subservient press.&#8221;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>In the wake of a major journalistic scandal in the United States, broken open in the last week, I have to say that America&#8217;s establishment press has never been technically better, but never more pathetically subservient. My hopes increasingly ride on an often bad free press that is getting better all the time.</p>
<p>Let me also say, upfront, that there are honorable exceptions in the top ranks of America&#8217;s major media organizations. But in what may well be seen someday as a seminal event in U.S. media history, senior people at the two newspapers widely considered to offer the most comprenensive political coverage have admitted &#8212; and, God help us, <em>defended</em> &#8212; their technically good subservience to the American government.</p>
<p>Salon colleague Glenn Greenwald has <a href="http://www.salon.com/news/media_criticism/index.html?story=/opinion/greenwald/2010/07/03/keller">discussed in detail</a> the truly disheartening response to a Harvard study showing that the Washington Post and New York Times skewed their coverage of America&#8217;s post-9/11 torture policy, using the Bush administration&#8217;s newspeak language &#8212; &#8220;harsh interrogation techniques&#8221; was a favorite &#8212; instead of plain old &#8220;torture,&#8221; the word they&#8217;d previously used to describe the same acts.</p>
<p>And then, when asked why, top <a href="http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/07/02/study-of-waterboarding-coverage-prompts-a-debate-in-the-press/" target="_blank">editors and spokespeople at both papers effectively said</a> that once the Bush administration and Republican allies had pushed for the new language, the news organizations were duty-bound to use it, too, or else be seen as slanting the news.</p>
<p>That the news organizations had changed their language was itself disgraceful. That they then compounded the damage, with a defense that was almost the definition of a subservient press, was heartbreaking.</p>
<p>But George Orwell was rolling in his grave &#8212; perhaps with joy that he&#8217;s been <a href="http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2010/07/03/keller/index.html#postid-updateA1">proved so right</a>, but also pure despair.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>I&#8217;m participating at a pair of conferences in South Africa this week,<a href="http://highwayafrica.com/" target="_blank">Highway Africa</a> and the <a href="http://wjec.ru.ac.za/" target="_blank">World Journalism Education Congress</a>. (Some of the travel costs for me and a companion have been covered by the<a href="http://wjec.ru.ac.za/news/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=27&amp;Itemid=30&amp;lang=en" target="_blank">conference sponsors</a>.) It&#8217;s my fourth time at Highway Africa, a gathering that brings together many of Africa&#8217;s most forward-looking journalists for conversations, among other things, about the way technology is enabling the future.</p>
<p>Africa is a huge and diverse place, and the state of journalistic freedom reflects the differences: nil to relatively robust. Guy Berger, head of the Rhodes University journalism program (and someone who&#8217;s become a friend), says there&#8217;s more and more bad free press, and a positive trajectory in terms of quality.</p>
<p>But he shows me a bulletin board, the old-fashioned analog kind, on which clippings describe the ongoing struggles for freedom in many places; jailings, beatings and assassinations are a growing reality for journalists around the world &#8212; the victims typically  people who are trying to shine a light on what their governments or other powerful interests are doing.</p>
<p>On my first trip to Africa in 2001, I was with a group of journalists who visited nearby Zambia to offer Internet workshops to media people who were just getting wind of the potential in the emerging networks. We were scheduled to meet Fred M&#8217;membe, editor of <a href="http://www.postzambia.com/post-index.php?page=home" target="_blank">the Post</a>, an independent newspaper there, but he was in court defending himself against government pressure. Now he is <a href="http://allafrica.com/stories/201006300549.html" target="_blank">in prison</a>.</p>
<p>I told the journalists I met then, and at the two other Highway Africa conferences where I&#8217;ve spoken, that I feel great humility in their presence. Like others around the world who risk their liberty, and sometimes their life, for their work, they remind us all of why telling the truth to and about the rich and powerful is so important.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Today is Independence Day in the United States. I&#8217;m proud of what we have done so right in America, and believe, more than ever, in the ideals of our nation. For me, it&#8217;s America, right <em>and </em>wrong. We do get it wrong, horribly so on occasion, but we have had the institutions in place to correct ourselves time and again.</p>
<p>One of those institutions is the press. When it does its job.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not naive about the long-standing flaws of American journalism. It&#8217;s never been as great as our mythology. But it has often shone when the chips were down.</p>
<p>They are today. Never have we needed truly independent journalism institutions &#8212; which despite great progress in the developement of online media still convey most of what we call &#8220;news&#8221; to most of the people &#8212; more than we do now.</p>
<p>The honorable exceptions aside, they are failing. And they&#8217;re failing arrogantly, insisting that they are doing their jobs well when the evidence is so obviously to the contrary.</p>
<p>I have less and less confidence that the technically excellent journocrats who work in the newsrooms of most major media organizations, especially the ones that have become so embedded in the political and economic power structures, will ever recover their independence.</p>
<p>Bloggers and other entrants in the newer media were barely on the radar in 2002, but I suspect Mandela would agree that some of the &#8220;bad free press&#8221; today comes from their ranks. I actually believe some of the best good journalism is coming from the new media, but we have to acknowledge that most online conversations don&#8217;t hit the high points of our best journalistic principles.</p>
<p>So, yes, my hopes increasingly are with the free-for-all &#8212; call it the cacophony or whatever you want &#8212; that may frequently be bad but which is getting better. I have absolute confidence that people who join this new journalistic ecosystem for the right reasons, and who do it badly, can learn to be good, because they can learn why it matters to do things in a trustworthy way.</p>
<p>The New York Times and Washington Post have done wonderful work through their modern existence. But their failures are so profound in recent years that it&#8217;s hard to maintain any confidence in them.</p>
<p>So for all of the excellence they&#8217;ve fostered, the editors at these famous institutions who refused to call torture what it was &#8212; bowing to the bogus and odious idea that channeling partisan propaganda was serving their readers &#8212; harmed their organizations with those cowardly word games.</p>
<p>And when they defended their acts of cowardice and dismissed criticism as tendentious, they went beyond harm. Their pride in subservience was a disgrace.</p>
<p>What, I wonder, does Independence Day mean to them?</p>

<h2>Local dailies in Hollywood and Silicon Valley get counter-intuitive on copyright-vs.-progress story</h2>
<p>Just as politicians tend to favor positions taken by the people who pay for their campaigns, local newspapers tend to editorialize in favor of the prevailing economic realities in their regions. That&#8217;s why it was surprising in recent days to see how the top daily newspapers in their respective regions of California handled Google&#8217;s <a href="http://bit.ly/cFCyMH" target="_blank">victory</a>, at least temporarily, over Viacom in a copyright case that&#8217;s one battle in the war over who&#8217;ll control the Internet.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll recall that a federal judge <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/24/technology/24google.html?ref=business" target="_blank">slapped down Viacom&#8217;s claim</a> that Google&#8217;s YouTube video service, by allowing its copyrighted videos to be posted on the site, was contributing to copyright infringement. The judge said YouTube was following provisions of the current copyright law that say, among other things, that a site owner is not immediately responsible for what others post there. However, once notified by a copyright holder that it&#8217;s hosting infringing work, the site is obliged to take it down.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the Los Angeles Times, which has often pitched Hollywood&#8217;s angle on a variety of issues, published a surprisingly <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/editorials/la-ed-youtube-20100629,0,2290414.story" target="_blank">perceptive editorial</a>, very much not taking the film studios&#8217; side. The piece observed that the judge&#8217;s ruling was a needed rebuff to yet &#8220;another effort to shift copyright holders&#8217; responsibilities onto the middlemen who have opened new distribution pathways online.&#8221; It went on:</p>
<blockquote><p>Those efforts are understandable, given how quickly works can spread around the world, and how many sites can become unauthorized sources. But speedy, low-cost distribution is one of the great advantages of the Internet, not a flaw.</p></blockquote>
<p>There was more than a little sympathy for the Hollywood dilemma &#8212; way more than the Copyright Cartel deserves, in my view &#8212; but the Times editorial page showed worthy independence of immensely powerful local interests in its analysis. Two cheers for the Times.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s just one cheer for the San Francisco Chronicle&#8217;s editorial board after reading its <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2010/06/28/EDF11E4FUV.DTL" target="_blank">day-earlier take</a> on the ruling &#8212; and that&#8217;s solely because the Chronicle didn&#8217;t genuflect to the Bay Area&#8217;s dominant local businesses in Silicon Valley&#8217;s technology community. They overwhelmingly sided with Google in the matter, for sound reasons that go beyond money. (My view on the case, as <a href="http://www.salon.com/technology/dan_gillmor/2010/06/24/viacom_loses_free_speech_wins">posted here</a> last week, is that the ruling meant progress for free speech and collaboration much more than a milestone in a corporate war.)</p>
<p>The Chronicle&#8217;s editorial grudgingly accepts that the judge knew what he was talking about regarding the law, but that seems to be the problem. For the editorial writer, this is really about who&#8217;s going to control content on the Internet &#8212; and for the Chronicle, control appears to be binary:  If the creator of media content can&#8217;t have absolute control, he or she will be forced to give it away.</p>
<p>The final line is the tip-off to what&#8217;s ultimately on the minds of the editorial board: payment for creating media. Calling for new copyright laws &#8212; though what they should contain never makes its way into the piece &#8212; the newspaper says, &#8220;We can&#8217;t expect people to create things for free &#8212; unless we believe that the only people in our society who can be creative are those who are already rich.&#8221;</p>
<p>Actually, we can expect people to create lots of things for free, even people who aren&#8217;t rich. They always have, and always will. And we can expect the creative destruction of technological and economic competition to bring us adapted or new business models that will accept technology&#8217;s realities and not try to push the proverbial toothpaste back into the tube.</p>

<h2>Journalists should report rather than playing bit roles in what the nominee herself once called a &#8220;vapid charade&#8221;</h2>
<p>UPDATED</p>
<p>By the third day of the Elena Kagan hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, the Washington press corps had pretty much moved onto other things. Two days earlier, journalists had crowded the room where Kagan, President Obama&#8217;s nominee to replace retiring Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens, faced committee members in what was billed as her only remotely serious public discussion of the court and her likely role on it.</p>
<p>Talking Points Memo mentioned the journalistic drop-off in a <a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/2010/06/media_losing_interest.php?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Talking-Points-Memo+%28Talking+Points+Memo%3A+by+Joshua+Micah+Marshall%29" target="_blank">terse item</a> titled &#8220;Media Losing Interest?&#8221; I promptly tweeted along with a comment about &#8220;Journalism&#8217;s short attention span&#8221; &#8212; and got a <a href="http://twitter.com/howardweaver/status/17462607347" target="_blank">Twitter reply</a> from Howard Weaver, who said, &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t staff Kagan hearings if it were my call. It&#8217;s all Kabuki theater; if any news manages to emerge, it will be reported.﻿&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://howardweaver.com/" target="_blank">Howard Weaver</a> is former vice president of news for the McClatchy Co., and when he says something like this it&#8217;s worth thinking about. Keep in mind that McClatchy, which bought Knight Ridder a few years ago and has faced the same financial woes as the rest of the industry, maintained the high standards of the Washington bureau that consistently outclassed the rest of the Washington press corps in covering the run-up to the Iraq war (mainly by letting reporters do their jobs, not serving as bended-knee stenographers for the Bush administration).</p>
<p>So I did think about it, and ended up mostly agreeing with him. There is little point to sending platoons of reporters to largely ceremonial events where the players all know their tedious roles and do their absolute best not to stray into territory that might conceivably make actual news. In Kagan&#8217;s case, it was a non-surprise that she did a nearly total retreat from her <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Confirmation-Messes.pdf" target="_blank">1995 law review article</a> (pdf) in which she accurately called modern nomination hearings &#8220;a vapid and hollow charade.&#8221;</p>
<p>The senators, for the most part, are part of the charade. Like most politicians in front of video cameras, they preen more than probe. So, with live-streamed video capturing everyone&#8217;s words and live-bloggers<a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/live/elena-kagan-confirmation-hearings/#342047" target="_blank">feeding tidbits</a> to anyone who cares, why bother to use staff time for such affairs? Any news that emerges will reach the world soon enough.</p>
<p>The days when it made sense for every major media organization to be at almost anything have long since passed, especially given the traditional news industry&#8217;s well-chronicled cutbacks. Political campaigns are one arena where news folks have <a href="http://www.ajr.org/article.asp?id=4644" target="_blank">realized it&#8217;s not necessary to &#8220;compete&#8221;</a> for tiny changes in stump speeches.</p>
<p>The worrisome cuts are in <a href="http://www.poynter.org/column.asp?id=45&amp;aid=184034" target="_blank">places like state capitals</a>, where legislators, regulators and lobbyists are learning they can pretty much do what they want without the inconvenience of being observed. The same is increasingly true in the nation&#8217;s capital, as major agencies get covered sparsely by traditional media while specialized media with small, paying audiences pretty much take over what coverage there is.</p>
<p>Washington bureaus already know this, but maybe they&#8217;ll start acting on it: There&#8217;s plenty to keep an eye on in Washington without spending more time than absolutely necessary at the Judiciary Theater.</p>

		<p><em>This article was </em><a href="http://www.salon.com/technology/dan_gillmor/2010/06/30/real_transparency_in_media/index.html" target="_blank"><em>originally published</em></a><em> on Salon on June 30, 2010.</em></p>
<h2>The political website, discovering serious problems with its pollster, comes excruciatingly clean with its audience</h2>
<p>Here&#8217;s how Markos Moulitsas started a post yesterday at the <a href="http://dailykos.com/" target="_blank">Daily Kos</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I have just <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2010/6/29/880179/-Research-2000:-Problems-in-plain-sight" target="_blank">published a report</a> by three statistics wizards showing, quite convincingly, that the weekly Research 2000 State of the Nation poll we ran the past year and a half was likely bunk.</p></blockquote>
<p>If there&#8217;s a Mother of All Corrections, this comes pretty close. When the proprietor of a well-known and widely followed media organization brings something this awful to the attention of his audience, and in such a forceful and prominent way, he&#8217;s doing something fairly rare &#8212; and noteworthy.</p>
<p>My survey research and statistics skills aren&#8217;t strong enough to vouch for what the statistics wizards came up with, but the redoubtable <a href="http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2010/06/breaking-daily-kos-to-sue-research-2000.html" target="_blank">Nate Silver is doing just that</a>. In short, there is a huge problem &#8212; and that&#8217;s the best possible construction &#8212; in this data.</p>
<p>The Atlantic&#8217;s Max Fisher has an <a href="http://www.theatlanticwire.com/opinions/view/opinion/Internet-Goes-to-War-as-Daily-Kos-Renounces-Its-Long-Time-Polling-Firm-4170" target="_blank">excellent aggregation</a> about the fighting, legal and otherwise, surrounding this debacle. Lots of it, as you&#8217;d expect, is purely political, unsurprising given the Daily Kos mission. I suspect this will be a case study worthy of a masters thesis.</p>
<p>I cannot imagine a traditional media organization &#8212; and more than a few have used this pollster &#8212; showing the same level of transparency that Markos has done. (Speaking of transparency, I should note that Markos is a longtime friendly acquaintance.) I can only imagine how he must have felt when he learned of the problems with the polling.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s what he did next that matters here: He gathered facts and then issued, in excruciating detail, a report to his readers.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s be clear on one thing: If, in fact, Daily Kos has been running fraudulent polls the past several years, the site has taken a credibility hit, a serious one. But that doesn&#8217;t mean I&#8217;m about to delete the site from my browser bookmarks or RSS feeds, and the main reason I won&#8217;t do so is that the site is being so up-front about what happened.</p>
<p>Media organizations have traditionally been among the most opaque of institutions. Trust us or don&#8217;t, they&#8217;ve said in the past &#8212; and what they&#8217;ve meant was, you can take what we say as The Truth. That&#8217;s no longer good enough, not that it ever was, and the smarter ones are opening up, though the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/11/national/11PAPE.html" target="_blank">notable examples</a> tend to be exceptions, not the rule.</p>
<p>The more honest we are about our errors, and we all make them, the more we may feel we&#8217;re letting people assume that what we do is flawed. Well, in journalism and other fast-moving media, what we do often <em>is</em>flawed. The best we can do is to try hard to follow the other principles of journalism that include accuracy and thoroughness, and then own up, fast, when we get it wrong.</p>
<p>For those of us creating media, genuine transparency will lead audiences to believe us less. That&#8217;s fine, because healthy audience skepticism is the first principle of smart media consumption.</p>
<p>But transparency will also lead people to trust us more. That&#8217;s not a paradox.</p>

		<p><em>This article was </em><a href="http://www.salon.com/technology/dan_gillmor/2010/06/29/google_retreats_in_china/index.html" target="_blank"><em>originally published</em></a><em> on Salon on June 29, 2010.</em></p>
<h2>Search giant gives Beijing half a loaf, but will regime be satisfied?</h2>
<p>Clever dodge or capitulation? Google&#8217;s latest move in its ongoing battles with China looks like a bit of both.</p>
<p>When Google closed its search operations in China last March rather than obey government censorship edicts, the search company tried some<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/23/technology/23google.html" target="_blank">corporate judo</a>: It redirected searches from Chinese customers to servers in Hong Kong, thereby providing more honest results than the ones it replaced.</p>
<p>Too clever by half, the Beijing regime decided &#8212; and it ordered Google to stop its tactic or lose its ability to do pretty much any business in the world&#8217;s most populous nation. Disappointingly but not surprisingly, Google has <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/2010/06/google-stops-redirect-for-chinese-users.html" target="_blank">done just that</a>.</p>
<p>But in what is clearly a concession to the latest Bejing must-censor edicts, Google offered half a loaf to China search users and a half-raised middle finger to Beijing: They can still get the mostly uncensored Hong Kong results, but now they have to do so via hyperlinks rather than automatically. David Drummond, Google&#8217;s top lawyer, <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/06/update-on-china.html" target="_blank">explained it this way</a> on the company&#8217;s blog:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>We have therefore been looking at possible alternatives, and instead of automatically redirecting all our users, we have started taking a small percentage of them to a landing page on <a href="http://google.cn/" target="_blank">Google.cn</a>that links to <a href="http://google.com.hk/" target="_blank">Google.com.hk</a>—where users can conduct web search or continue to use Google.cn services like music and text translate, which we can provide locally without filtering. This approach ensures we stay true to our commitment not to censor our results on Google.cn and gives users access to all of our services from one page.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>But how long will this last? China is nothing if not peristent on its censorship, and it&#8217;s hard to imagine that the Beijing censors will sit still for what they&#8217;re likely to see as further insult.</p>
<p>Rebecca MacKinnon, visiting Fellow at Princeton&#8217;s <a href="http://citp.princeton.edu/" target="_blank">Center for Information Technology Policy</a> (as well as friend and former colleague at the Harvard <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society</a>), sees the situation playing out in <a href="http://rconversation.blogs.com/rconversation/2010/06/googles-china-troubles.html" target="_blank">four possible scenarios</a>, each of which feels plausible. I&#8217;m not making a guess, because the Google-China tussle is so fluid.</p>
<p>Eventually, one guesses, Google will have to make the most serious decision of all: whether to shut down China operations entirely or keep making concessions. Will its fiduciary duty to shareholders outweigh moral concerns? Right, silly question.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><em>This article was </em><a href="http://www.salon.com/technology/dan_gillmor/2010/06/28/fifa_censors_video_replays/index.html" target="_blank"><em>originally published</em></a><em> on Salon on June 28, 2010.</em></p>
<h2>Soccer czars&#8217; ban of in-stadium video replays only postpones reality</h2>
<p>The czars of football (or soccer, as we call it in the U.S.), stung repeatedly by poor officiating in the World Cup tournament in South Africa, have come up with a way to mute protests inside the stadiums: pretend the mistakes aren&#8217;t happening by blocking any in-stadium video replays.</p>
<p>As the AP <a href="http://www.wtop.com/?nid=157&amp;sid=1990619" target="_blank">reports</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>FIFA will censor World Cup match action being shown on giant screens inside the stadium after replays of Argentina&#8217;s disputed first goal against Mexico fueled arguments on the pitch.﻿</p></blockquote>
<p>The proximate event was a goal scored by a player who was offside before he took his shot. A spokesman for FIFA (the governing body of international football), Nicolas Maingot﻿, regretted the &#8220;clear mistake.&#8221;</p>
<p>What mistake? Why, the video replay, not the actual officiating flub.</p>
<p>Yep, that&#8217;ll work. Actually it will, for now, if the majority of people inside the stadium are kept in the dark (assuming they missed the rules violation in the first place), which is the point of this exercise. Meanwhile, in living rooms and bars around the world, everyone else will have a close-up view of the officiating mistakes.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not as if FIFA is alone in making this kind of decision. Salon colleague <a href="http://dir.salon.com/topics/king_kaufman/">King Kaufman</a>, who forgets more about professional sports every week than I&#8217;ve ever learned, tells me it&#8217;s fairly standard practice not to show big-screen replays of close calls in major U.S. professional and collegiate (OK, same thing) sports. No doubt Major League Baseball, which has its <a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20100602&amp;content_id=10727590" target="_blank">own prominent cases</a> of staggeringly bad calls, is watching all this with interest.</p>
<p>But let&#8217;s consider where technology is heading to understand why the giant screens inside the stadiums aren&#8217;t going to remain the only issue.</p>
<p>Even today, it&#8217;s likely that some spectators could have seen the offside video almost immediately on video-equipped mobile phones. By the time the next World Cup rolls around, that will be most of the people inside the stadium. Will FIFA block mobile video access to ensure that official bumbles remain unseen by the people actually attending the events?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sympathetic to FIFA in one respect. Soccer is a game of flow; it would change dramatically if officials repeatedly stopped the matches to review video footage &#8212; though correcting egregiously wrong calls on whether a goal had been scored would be an obvious place where it would make sense, as opposed to a missed offside, which happens all the time. But to pretend that the videos don&#8217;t exist isn&#8217;t going to work much longer.</p>
