	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><img src="http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/pierre-omidyar.png" alt="pierre omidyar.png" border="0" width="271" height="245" align="left" hspace=5 vspace=2 /><a href="http://www.omidyar.com/team/pierre-omidyar">Pierre Omidyar</a>, founder of eBay, is launching a for-profit news startup in Hawaii, where he and his family live. This is important news, and not just because he&#8217;s involved.</p>
<p>A few months ago Pierre and Randy Ching founded <a href="http://peernews.com">Peer News</a>. Their first project was a Twitter-related experiment called <a href="http://www.ginx.com">Ginx</a>, which didn&#8217;t get critical mass and is being closed.</p>
<p>Now they&#8217;ve announced Peer News&#8217; more important move &#8212; a project aimed at creating the kind of local journalism that brings accountability and value to a community. </p>
<p>Pierre, in a note on the <a href="http://blog.peernews.com/interest-lead/http://blog.peernews.com/2009/11/18/aloha/">company blog</a>, says he and his team are launching &#8212; they aim for early 2010 &#8212; based on deep research: &#8220;talking to a lot of people in the industry about journalism and how we might be able to have an impact, listening and learning as much as we can.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m one of the people Pierre has talked with, but I&#8217;m not privy to the details of the new venture. In a conversation last evening, he did say this will be service combining professional journalists and citizen journalists in &#8220;a commercial model that hasn&#8217;t been tried yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tantalizing, no? Let&#8217;s focus for a second on the word &#8220;commercial,&#8221; because Pierre and team are going for something that seems to have fallen somewhat out of favor for local news startups, the notion that they can and should be profitable. Not-for-profits are springing up in various places, and while Pierre is happy to see them he also believes it&#8217;s essential to find solid for-profit models for sustainable media.</p>
<p>One message is for the local newspapers: Watch out. Pierre has analyzed the Hawaii media market and sees enough advertising money is going toward journalism in Honolulu &#8220;to fund a high quality operation&#8221; &#8212; but clearly not the kind that dominates the revenue stream today, namely the local newspapers.</p>
<p>Peer News will operate in the leanest possible way compatible with doing solid journalism and community information. It will involve social media in a big way as well. (The <a href="http://omidyar.net">Omidyar Network</a>, the investing and charitable arm of Pierre and his wife, Pam, has been deep into socially valuable media for a long time. Count on them bringing what they&#8217;ve learned into Peer News.)</p>
<p>Plainly, the Hawaii launch is a test bed, in part. If it works, expect more local versions in other places. </p>
<p>Peer News is looking for a founding editor. My advice has been to find someone local, if at all possible, but especially to find someone excellent. If you&#8217;re interested, <a href="http://blog.peernews.com/interest-lead/">here&#8217;s where</a> you can find out more.</p>
<p>One of the people who&#8217;ll be talking to editorial candidates is Howard Weaver, a former vice president of news at McClatchy. Howard has been consulting with Peer News and offers some perspective on his <a href="http://editor.blogspot.com/2009/11/looking-toward-one-future-for-local.html">own blog</a>, including this:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I’m interested for a lot of reasons, but I’d sum it up this way: the new venture intends to demonstrate that a digitally native, technologically fluent web organization can profitably serve targeted readers who want sophisticated journalism focused on local civic affairs.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Maybe Pierre and his team have cracked part of the code for sustainable digital journalism. Maybe not. But the fact that they&#8217;re going to try, with some serious resources behind the effort, is great news.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;m looking forward to following the progress of Peer News. So should anyone who&#8217;s interested in the future of journalism. </p>
<p><em>(Note: The Omidyar Network was a seed funder of my long-ago Grassroots Media (Bayosphere) project. It lost money.)</em></p>

<blockquote><p><em>embed the upload functionality of YouTube directly into your own site, enabling your organization to request, review, and re-broadcast user-submitted videos with ease. News organizations can ask for citizen reporting; nonprofits can call-out for support videos around social campaigns; businesses can ask users to submit promotional videos about your brand.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Essentially this lets anyone create the equivalent of CNN&#8217;s <a href="http://www.ireport.com/">iReport</a> operation. It&#8217;s a smart move by YouTube, and a welcome one in many respects. </p>
<p>But it&#8217;s the equivalent of iReport in another way that&#8217;s just as unfortunate as the original: no compensation for the video creators apart from a pat on the back.</p>
<p>In fact, it&#8217;s worse than that. Look at the <a href="http://www1.whdh.com/termsofuse">terms of service</a> at Channel 7 in Boston, one of YouTube&#8217;s partners, which include the following:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>(W)hen you submit or post any material, you are granting us, and anyone authorized by us, a royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, unrestricted, worldwide license to use, copy, modify, transmit, sell, exploit, create derivative works from, distribute and/or publicly perform or display such material, in whole or in part, in any manner or medium, now known or hereafter developed, for any purpose. The foregoing grant shall include the right to exploit any proprietary rights in such posting or submission, including, but not limited to, rights under copyright, trademark, service mark, patent or other intellectual property law under any relevant jurisdiction.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>As far as I can tell, none of the partners has even suggested an intention to pay anyone for what they submit. Which makes the tool a giveaway for the creator &#8212; and a windfall for the collector, not to mention YouTube, which cements its position in online video.</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s a silver lining. YouTube has open-sourced the platform. This means someone could add a feature the system desperately needs. I wrote about it a few months ago in <a href="http://mediactive.com/2009/07/29/needed-real-time-media-auction-system/">this post</a>. </p>
<p>To repeat what I said then, we need better ways: </p>
<blockquote><p><em>to reward creators when it comes to breaking news, where news organizations derive enormous benefits from having the right image or video at the right time and too frequently get it for less than peanuts. Indeed, practically every news organization now invites its audience to submit pictures and videos, in return for which the submitters typically get zip.</p>
<p>Which is why we need a more robust marketplace than any I’ve seen so far, namely a real-time auction system.</p>
<p>The sites currently promoting citizen journalists’ work don’t offer anything of this sort, as far as I can tell. This isn’t to say I don’t like those sites, which include NowPublic and Demotix, because I like them a great deal. But someone needs to go further.</p>
<p>How would a real-time auction system work? The flow, I’d imagine, would go like this:</p>
<p>Photographer captures breaking news event on video or audio, and posts the work to the auction site. Potential buyers, especially media companies, get to see watermarked thumbnails and then start bidding. A time limit is enforced in each case. The winning bid goes to the journalist, minus a cut to the auction service.</p>
<p>The premium, then, would be on timeliness and authenticity. One or two images/videos would be likely to command relatively high prices, and everything else would be worth considerably less.</p>
<p>Eventually, someone will do this kind of business — which could also be useful for eyewitness text accounts of events. For the sake of the citizen journalists who are not getting what they deserve for their work, I hope it’s sooner than later.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>This is worth working on, and fast, before the news industry decides it has found a nifty way to make money on other people&#8217;s work.</p>

		<blockquote><p>NY Times: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/13/us/13wiki.html?_r=2">Two German Killers Demanding Anonymity Sue Wikipedia’s Parent</a>.<em> Wolfgang Werlé and Manfred Lauber became infamous for killing a German actor in 1990. Now they are suing to force Wikipedia to forget them.</em></p>
<p><em>The legal fight pits German privacy law against the American First Amendment. German courts allow the suppression of a criminal’s name in news accounts once he has paid his debt to society, noted Alexander H. Stopp, the lawyer for the two men, who are now out of prison.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Support_Wikipedia/en"><img class="alignleft" style="border: 0pt none; margin: 20px 4px;" src="http://wikimediafoundation.org/w/extensions/skins/Donate/images/banners/Banner_125x125_0000_A.jpg" border="0" alt="Wikipedia Affiliate Button" width="125" height="125" /></a><br />
Old laws are inadequate to new eras and technologies, and political boundaries have limited meaning in a networked world.</p>
<p>The German law balanced the rights of those who&#8217;d served their time against public knowledge, and came down, by any American First Amendment standard, absurdly far on the  wrong side. But it is well-meaning, and was written in a time when it was possible to control what media did within a political jurisdiction, at least for widespread public attention, not in a time when anyone can publish for a global audience.</p>
<p>The networked-world element of the case is a reminder of an ongoing problem in the Digital Age. It&#8217;s bad enough that the Germans have such a law, but it&#8217;s their country. What&#8217;s clearly over the top is trying to pull this information from the English version. The Wikimedia Foundation has rightly refused. (This reminds me to make a <a href="http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Support_Wikipedia2">donation to the project</a>.)</p>
<p>I worry that the German lawyers &#8212; and authorities &#8212; will escalate. Even though Wikimedia has no assets in Germany, I&#8217;d be unsurprised if the case finds its way into American courts, for no other purpose than forcing the foundation to spend money defending itself. That&#8217;s a punishment in its own right.</p>
<p>And suppose the German lawyers persuade courts there to order the arrest of Wikimedia Foundation employees should they visit the country. This isn&#8217;t probable, no doubt, but if I were on the board I&#8217;d keep a close eye on the risks of stopping in Germany even to change planes.</p>
<p>The broader lessons are part of the changing nature of communications &#8212; and of changing norms. The Electronic Frontier Foundation&#8217;s Jennifer Grannick addresses the former, in context of this case, in <a href="http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2009/11/murderer-wikipedia-shhh">this way</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>At stake is the integrity of history itself. If all publications have to abide by the censorship laws of any and every jurisdiction just because they are accessible over the global internet, then we will not be able to believe what we read, whether about Falun Gong (censored by China), the Thai king (censored under</em> lèse majesté<em>) or German murders.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>We&#8217;ll be fighting these fights for decades to come. People who would control what others can read (listen to, view, etc.) &#8212; in order to control what they think and, ultimately, do &#8212; will not stop trying to have such powers. (Reminder to self: Send <a href="https://secure.eff.org/site/Donation2?df_id=1480&amp;1480.donation=form1&amp;s_src=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.eff.org%2Fdeeplinks%2F2009%2F11%2Fmurderer-wikipedia-shhh&amp;s_subsrc=default">EFF a donation</a>, too.)</p>
<p>But the deeper, harder issue is changing norms, because we have to ask ourselves if we truly want permanent records of everything we&#8217;ve ever done &#8212; and if there&#8217;s no choice in that matter whether we want people only to know us for the worst of our actions, not the sum of ourselves.</p>
<p>The German murders, Werlé and Lauber, don&#8217;t get much sympathy in this regard. Nor should they: Murder strikes me as the central act of these men&#8217;s lives, though we should also note that they have paid the debt to their society that entitles them to re-enter that society with some respect from others, difficult as that may be. Do they really expect, however, that even a ban on publishing their names will expunge their deeds from people&#8217;s knowledge? Yet the motive behind the German law is a sound one: to help those who&#8217;ve transgressed restore their membership in society.</p>
<p>As the Wall Street Journal reported this week, job seekers are trying to get minor criminal offenses <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB125789494126242343.html">fully expunged</a> from court records and online databases, especially ones where plea agreements promised such nullifying of the record. We are apparently so unforgiving as a society that even an arrest at some point in your life can be a job disqualification, even if you were totally innocent or if the charge was absurdly petty.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the problem. Databases will keep this stuff around, and on a Web where duplication is the nature of the system, there will ultimately be no way to fully get rid of anything &#8212; or at least we won&#8217;t be able to rely on its disappearance, whether through the obscurity of printed records in dusty courthouse basements or actual destruction of records as promised.</p>
<p>Which comes back to changing norms. Until we start weighing old acts against the totality of someone&#8217;s experiences and deeds, we&#8217;ll hold a sword over each others&#8217; head. Is this really the way we want to live?</p>

		<p>UPDATED</p>
<p><a href="http://www.latimes.com/la-na-fort-hood-vigil-sl,0,1154265.storylink"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-918 alignleft" style="margin: 3px;" title="candles" src="http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/candles-150x150.jpg" alt="candles" width="90" height="90" /></a>In the minutes and hours after an Army officer <a href="http://news.google.com/news/more?um=1&amp;cf=all&amp;ned=us&amp;cf=all&amp;ncl=daab1UqJeJh0YNMaDYsOGigATwtEM">opened fire</a> on his fellow soldiers at Fort Hood, Texas, last week,  the media floodgates opened in a now-standard way. A torrent of news reports and commentary poured from the scene, the immediate community and the Pentagon, amplified by corollary data, informed commentary and rank speculation from journalists, bloggers, podcasters, Tweeters, texters and more.</p>
<p>Also standard in this age of fast news was the quality of the early information: utterly unreliable, and mostly wrong. The shooter was dead; no he wasn&#8217;t. There were two accomplices; no there weren&#8217;t. And so on. (See Greg Marx&#8217;s <a href="http://www.cjr.org/campaign_desk/jumping_to_confusion.php">&#8220;Jumping to Confusion&#8221; </a>at CJR, and Glenn Greenwald&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2009/11/06/reporting/index.html">media orgy</a>&#8221; post at Salon.)</p>
<p><object style="width: 240px; height: 149px;" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="240" height="149" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/qwS5uLk_1z4&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0&amp;border=1" /><param name="align" value="right" /><param name="vspace" value="3" /><param name="hspace" value="3" /><embed style="width: 240px; height: 149px;" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="240" height="149" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/qwS5uLk_1z4&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0&amp;border=1" hspace="3" vspace="3" align="right"></embed></object>This was not, as several critics have claimed, a failure of citizen journalism. (That the most prominent such accusation came from a web-news operation that is notorious for its rumor-mongering and fact-challenged ways is too rich for words, and definitely not going to draw a link from me.) There was plenty of bullshit to go around that day, at all levels of media. Lots of people quoted President Obama&#8217;s admonition (watch the video) to <a href="http://content.usatoday.com/communities/theoval/post/2009/11/obama-speaks-on-fort-hood-as-well-as-high-unemployment/1">wait for the facts</a>, but almost no one followed it. And almost no one will heed Army Gen. George William Casey Jr.&#8217;s <a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/44/2009/11/08/restraint_urged_in_fort_hood_s.html?wprss=44">advice</a> on Sunday, to not jump to conclusions &#8220;based on little snippets of information that come out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Like many other people who&#8217;ve been burned by believing too quickly, I&#8217;ve learned to put almost all of what journalists call &#8220;breaking news&#8221; into the categories of gossip or, in the words of a scientist friend, &#8220;interesting if true.&#8221; That is, even though I gobble up &#8220;the latest&#8221; from a variety of sources, the closer the information is in time to the actual event, the more I assume it&#8217;s unreliable if not false.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow_Food"><img class="size-full wp-image-915 alignleft" style="margin: 3px;" title="Snail" src="http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/Screen-shot-2009-11-08-at-3.43.46-PM.png" alt="Snail" width="76" height="56" /></a>It&#8217;s my own version of &#8220;slow news&#8221; &#8212; an expression I first heard on Friday, coined by my friend <a href="http://ethanzuckerman.com/">Ethan Zuckerman</a> in a wonderful riff off the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow_Food">slow-food</a> movement. We were at a <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu">Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society</a> retreat in suburban Boston, in a group discussion of ways to improve the quality of what we know when we have so many sources from which to choose at every minute of the day.</p>
<p>One of society&#8217;s recently adopted cliches is the &#8220;24-hour news cycle&#8221; &#8212; the recognition that the once-a-day, manufacturing-based version of journalism has essentially passed into history for those who consume and create news via digital systems. Now, it&#8217;s said, we get news every hour of every day, and media creators work tirelessly to fill those hours with new stuff.</p>
<p>(UPDATE: Yes, I am aware that some print publications can, though few do, provide actual perspective. As several commenters have noted, meanwhile, the notion of slowing things down to achieve more perspective has been in the wild for a while now, though aimed more at the journalists; note Paul Bradshaw&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/pda/2009/jun/01/channel4-research1">slow journalism</a>&#8221; observation; Kirk Ross&#8217; <a href="http://pjnet.org/post/1615/">ideas</a> and this from <a href="http://snarkmarket.com/2005/721">Matt Thompson</a>. What I&#8217;m suggesting, as noted, is much more about audiences. See update at end.)</p>
<p>That 24-hour news cycle needs further adjustment. The first is that an hourly news cycle is itself too long. The latest can come at any minute in an era of TV police chases, Twitter and twitchy audiences. Call it the 1,440 minute news cycle.</p>
<p>Rapid-fire news is about speed, which has two main purposes for the provider. The first is human competitiveness, the desire to be first. In journalism newsrooms, scoops are a coin of the realm.</p>
<p>The second imperative is audience. Being first draws a crowd. Crowds can be turned into influence, money or both. Witness cable news channels&#8217; desperate hunt for &#8220;the latest&#8221; when big events are under way, even though the latest is so often the rankest garbage.</p>
<p>This applies not just to raw information (often wrong, remember) that&#8217;s the basis for breaking news. It&#8217;s also the case, for example, for the blogger who offers up the first sensible-sounding commentary that puts the &#8220;news&#8221; into perspective. The winners in the online commentary derby &#8212; which is just as competitive, though for lower financial stakes, as  &#8212; are the quick and deft writers who tell us what it means. That they&#8217;re often basing these perspectives on lies or well-meaning falsehoods seems to matter less than being early to comment.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not arguing here against human nature. We all want to know what&#8217;s going on, and the bigger the calamity the more we want to know. Nothing is going to change that, and nothing should.</p>
<p>Nor is this a new phenomenon. Speculation has passed for journalism in all media eras. Every commercial plane crash, for example, is followed by days (now more like minutes and hours) of brazen guessing by so-called experts who, to be sure, are occasionally proved correct after months of actual investigation by the real experts. Sometimes we never know the truth.</p>
<p>But the advent of 1,440 minute news cycle (should we call it the 86,400 second news cycle?), which brings with it an insatiable appetite for something new to talk about, should literally give us pause. Again and again, we&#8217;ve seen that initial assumptions can be grossly untrustworthy.</p>
<p>We all know that the Texas shooter wasn&#8217;t killed during his rampage, as was first reported. That&#8217;s because the story was still fresh enough, and the saturation coverage was ongoing, when it emerged that he hadn&#8217;t been shot dead by law enforcement.</p>
<p>But we all &#8220;know&#8221; things that were subsequently found to be untrue, in part because journalists typically don&#8217;t report outcomes with the same passion and play that they report the initial news. We&#8217;ve all seen videos of people who&#8217;ve been arrested  but who were later acquitted; yet the inherent bias in crime reporting has left reputations of innocent people shattered. And how many of us hear a report that such-and-such product or behavior has been found to raise cancer risk, but never hear the follow up that the report is either false or misleading?</p>
<p>The rapid-fire news system&#8217;s abundance of falsehoods has other causes than simple speed, including the decline of what&#8217;s supposed to be a staple of journalism: fact checking before running with a story.</p>
<p>Citing the grotesque &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_balloon_incident">balloon boy</a>&#8221; stunt, <a href="http://shirky.com">Clay Shirky</a> (also a friend) observed recently &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/cshirky/status/5020391901">in a Tweet</a>, no less &#8212; that &#8220;fact-checking is way down, and after-the-fact checking is way WAY up.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not entirely sure the balloon-boy situation is the best example of this phenomenon, because there weren&#8217;t all that many facts journalists <em>could</em> check during the time the balloon was in the air. The family&#8217;s publicly weird ways should have prompted much more skepticism, earlier than it did, but journalists went with the story in front of them.</p>
<p>Clay&#8217;s point is absolutely right in a general sense, however. It lends weight to slow news, to the idea that we all might be wise to think before we react, just as most of us failed to do during the early hours and days of the &#8220;#amazonfail&#8221; situation last April. As he <a href="http://www.shirky.com/weblog/2009/04/the-failure-of-amazonfail/">wrote then</a>, a lot of us were wrong and believed things that turned out not to be true &#8212; and we reacted with fury to something that was a mistake, not evil design. (I am one of those people.)</p>
<p>I rely in large part on gut instincts when I make big decisions, but my gut only gives me good advice when I&#8217;ve immersed myself in the facts about things that are important. This applies, more than ever, to news, where we need to be skeptical of just about everything we read, listen to and watch, though not equally skeptical.</p>
<p>A corollary to that is increasingly clear: to wait a bit, for evidence that is persuasive, before deciding what&#8217;s true and what&#8217;s not.</p>
<p>It comes down to this: The faster the news accelerates, the slower I&#8217;m inclined to believe anything I hear &#8212; and the harder I look for the coverage that pulls together the most facts with the most clarity about what&#8217;s known and what&#8217;s speculation.</p>
<p>Call it slow news. Call it critical thinking. Call it anything you want. Give some thought to adopting it for at least some of your media consumption, and creation.</p>
<p>UPDATE (and welcome to the <a href="http://boingboing.net">BoingBoing</a> crew): I shouldn&#8217;t have to say this, but several tweets have suggested that the answer is, uh, print and quality broadcasting. Newspapers and magazines and network news.</p>
<p>Of course this is true, in part. I cherish the New Yorker magazine (among others), and the dwindling number of daily newspapers and broadcasters that try to do this part of their jobs properly. To the extent that audiences decide this matters to them, maybe they&#8217;ll pick up some old habits.</p>
<p>But this isn&#8217;t about saving the old guard, and it really isn&#8217;t even about fixing (some of) what&#8217;s wrong with journalism. It&#8217;s mostly about persuading audiences to, among other things, &#8220;take a deep breath&#8221; before leaping to conclusions, as PaidContent&#8217;s Staci Kramer <a href="http://twitter.com/sdkstl/status/5544986523">tweeted</a>. (I don&#8217;t trust journalists to do this anymore, with too few exceptions.)</p>
<p>In a practical sense, we can help it along if we find ways to preserve a happy by-product of the manufacturing process. Or, as Clay puts it in an email, &#8220;the idea &#8212; that we have to get back, by design, the kinds of things we used to get as side-effects of the environment &#8212; is so important right now, and especially for news.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ethan Zuckerman also replied on his blog in a post called &#8220;<a href="http://www.ethanzuckerman.com/blog/2009/11/09/why-we-fall-for-fast-news/">Why we fall for fast news</a>&#8221; &#8212; as always, great insight. Excerpt:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Why do we persistently refresh news, looking for updates? (See </em><a href="http://www.ethanzuckerman.com/blog/2008/08/09/aps-ethnography-of-news-consumption/"><em>my comments on AP’s ethnography of news consumption</em></a><em>, which suggests that this is a common pattern.) It makes sense for certain types of news – if you’re directly impacted by an event, tracking a storm enroute to your town, for instance. But that’s not why we refresh most news – it’s rare that having the most timely (and, as Dan suggests, the least careful) information has a direct impact on our well-being.</em></p>
<p><em>Here are a couple of possibilities:</em></p>
<p><em>&#8211; The media made us do it. We don’t want to eat fast food, but that’s all we’re fed, due to the newsroom factors Dan suggests.</em></p>
<p><em>&#8211; We’re bored. AP’s “deep dive” suggests that relentless refreshing is something we do mostly when we’ve got nothing better to do.</em></p>
<p><em>&#8211; We’re building social capital. If we’ve got the most up-to-date information on the breaking news, we can use it to open conversations with friends and position ourselves as in the know, raising our stature.</em></p>
<p><em>&#8211; We’re narrative junkies. A breaking news story is like a novel that ends after a few chapters – we keep reloading in the hopes that someone will tell us the rest of the story.</em></p>
<p><em>I suspect there’s some truth to each of those explanations… and I suspect that each is badly incomplete. I also suspect that figuring out what drives our patterns of news consumption, and our susceptibility to fast, often-wrong news is critical for Dan’s slow-news movement to gain momentum.</em></p></blockquote>

		<p>Rupert Murdoch&#8217;s influence on the Wall Street Journal has not been the disaster many feared it would be when News Corp., the company he controls, bought Dow Jones several years ago. In many ways, the paper has actually improved.</p>
<p>The worry was that Murdoch would do what he&#8217;s done at almost every other media property he controls: Turn the journalism toward political ends. The Journal&#8217;s editorial page has been an entirely predictable arm of the American political right for some time now. Would that infect the news columns as well?</p>
<p>It appears that this is indeed happening. That&#8217;s the significance &#8212; assuming this is not a one-time case of an editor going overboard &#8212; of a news story in yesterday&#8217;s paper, which carried the headline, <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB125694593227919879.html">State Death Taxes Are the Latest Worry</a> and began this way:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>With the federal estate tax disappearing for most people, state death taxes have emerged as a surprise new worry.</em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>This is not neutral language. Nor is it accurate. It&#8217;s a deliberate perversion of language to make a political point; dead people do not pay taxes. Their estates and heirs do.</p>
<p>(The people who oppose estate/inheritance taxes have a variety of arguments against the practice. I side with <a href="http://www.forbes.com/2007/11/14/warren-buffett-tax-markets-cx_er_1114autofacescan02.html">Bill Gates Sr., Warren Buffett, several Rockefellers and lots of other people</a> who believe the arguments against the tax are specious and, more than that, dangerous to the nation&#8217;s future should  massive, untaxed transfers of wealth to people who haven&#8217;t earned a dime of it become the law of the land.)</p>
<p>The Journal&#8217;s editorial page has <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123846422014872229.html">called the estate tax a &#8220;death tax&#8221;</a> for years, in keeping with its wealth-equals-good stance on just about all issues. Moving this language to the news pages is a sign that the newspaper is taking on a more overt world view &#8212; a view that takes its lead from the truth-be-damned ideologues on the editorial page.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t mind that the Journal is doing this, though I suspect more than a few of the journalists who write for the paper must be having major qualms. In fact, it strikes me as healthy that the paper is showing its world view in such a deliberate way.</p>
<p>There are risks for News Corp. in taking this stance, not least a repeat of the self-marginalization that Fox &#8220;News&#8221; has chosen with its incessant BS, to the point that no one who cares about honest journalism has much respect for the channel. Fox has thrown away any reputation it might have had for being even remotely interested in contrary facts, because even its supposed straight news reporting so often takes a political stance and the lies of the commentators are so astonishingly in-your-face.</p>
<p>The greater risk, in the short run, is whether the Journal&#8217;s journalists will let themselves be turned into propagandists. This need not be the case.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://telegraph.co.uk">Telegraph</a> in London has a right-of-center view of the world, proudly so, even in its news pages. But its journalism is generally excellent, rarely (from my reading, at any rate) propaganda. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m all for the Wall Street Journal turning itself into an American equivalent of the Telegraph: a responsible news organization with a transparent world view. But should the Journal turn itself into a newspaper/Web version of its Fox TV channel, it will be making a fatal mistake in the long run.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Robert W. McChesney and John Nichols believe that <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/10/22/AR2009102203960.html">&#8220;journalists deserve subsidies, too</a>.&#8221; They argue that America is &#8220;nearing a point where we will no longer have more than minimal resources (relative to the nation&#8217;s size) dedicated to reporting the news.&#8221;</p>
<p>There&#8217;s every reason to dispute their woe-is-us assumption. There&#8217;s even more reason to say they are wildly off-base in calling for special subsidies for journalists.</p>
<p>The authors, longstanding activists in media reform, are exceedingly well-meaning. And they are more accurate than not when they say:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>We seek to renew a rich if largely forgotten legacy of the American free-press tradition, one that speaks directly to today&#8217;s crisis. The First Amendment necessarily prohibits state censorship, but it does not prevent citizens from using their government to subsidize and spawn independent media. </em></p>
<p><em>Indeed, the post-colonial press system was built on massive postal and printing subsidies. The first generations of Americans never imagined that the market would provide sound or sufficient journalism. The notion was unthinkable. They established enlightened subsidies, which broadened the marketplace of ideas and enhanced and protected core freedoms. Their initiatives were essential to America&#8217;s progress.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>If the authors had only pursued their logic, they&#8217;d have ended up at the only sensible conclusion &#8212; that taxpayers could well subsidize the equivalent of the postal and printing subsidies they celebrate (among many other infrastructure supports that helped get the news from one place to another, such as roads, never mind the <a href="http://mediactive.com/2009/05/13/governments-long-history-of-supporting-journalism/">variety of other government help</a> that&#8217;s gone to news organizations over the past several centuries.</p>
<p>What would following their logic lead us to in a digital world? That&#8217;s easy: We should collectively install dark fiber to every home and business where it&#8217;s feasible to do so, and put fiber as close to the ones that are too remote to make sense otherwise. It should be &#8220;dark fiber&#8221; &#8212; that is, data lines not controlled by government but available for others to light up to provide services for users.</p>
<p>This would not be about journalism only, any more than building roads in the 18th and 19th and 20th centuries was about helping newspapers deliver their goods to people&#8217;s homes and businesses. It would be about boosting trade of services and information (for-profit and not-for-profit), one part of which would be media.</p>
<p>We are seeing an explosion of creativity and innovation in media <em>and journalism</em> right now. Entrepreneurs and big companies alike are experimenting in new forms of journalism and ways to pay for it.</p>
<p>We have never had so much high-quality coverage in some areas, such as technology, as we have today. We have never had so much truly local conversation that has high value as we have today. And we will have vastly more tomorrow.</p>
<p>We may well be losing, at least temporarily, some of what <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=111985662">Alex Jones calls</a> &#8220;accountability journalism&#8221; &#8212; hard-nosed reporting of what powerful institutions, including government, are doing with our money and, in some cases, our lives. But to assume it will disappear and not be replaced, especially given some of the experiments we&#8217;re seeing, is grossly premature.</p>
<p>But Nichols and McChesney make that worst-case assumption, and veer off to this conclusion:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Saving newspapers may be impossible. But we can save journalism. Step one is to begin debating ways for enlightened public subsidies to provide a competitive and independent digital news media. Also, we should greatly expand funding for public and community media, and establish policies that help convert dying daily newspapers into post-corporate low-profit news operations that realize the potential of the Internet. If we do so, journalism and democracy will not just survive. They will flourish. </em></p></blockquote>
<p>We don&#8217;t need government support of this kind. It will lead us down a path that media reformers will rue: licensing of journalists, picking of winners and other pernicious outcomes.</p>
<p>Government surely does have a role, no question. But it should be to create the fundamental communications infrastructure on which tomorrow&#8217;s journalism can thrive.</p>

		<blockquote><p>Wall Street Journal: <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB125658217507308619.html?mod=WSJ_hps_MIDDLEForthNews">Lawyerese Goes Galactic as Contracts Try to Master the Universe &#8211; WSJ.com</a>. <em>Lawyers for years have added language to some contracts that stretches beyond the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere. But more and more people are encountering such everywhere-and-forever language as entertainment companies tap into amateur talent and try to anticipate every possible future stream of revenue.</em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Big Media companies have figured out that they can profit handsomely by persuading amateurs to make fools of themselves. That&#8217;s bad enough, but the really sleazy part of this is not rewarding the performers more fairly, if they reward them at all.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s one thing to host a website where others post their work and reserve rights to reuse that work, but still ensuring that the creators own the work in question. As long as everyone knows what&#8217;s going on, there&#8217;s no problem. It&#8217;s another thing to take this to wild extremes, as Hollywood  does. </p>
<p>When you are in a position of taking something with what you&#8217;ve created to a big-media company, you need to recognize that they hold all the power. This is why we need better mechanisms for pushing some of the power back to the creators. I&#8217;m working on some ideas and will be sharing them here, soon.</p>
