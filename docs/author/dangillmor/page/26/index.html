He was too cautious by half.</p>
<p>The question was from a student who wanted to be president some day and asked for advice on career paths. According to the White House transcript, he said, in the first of what he called &#8220;practical tips&#8221; for ambitious young people:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I want everybody here to be careful about what you post on Facebook &#8212; because in the YouTube age, whatever you do, it will be pulled up again later somewhere in your life. And when you&#8217;re young, you make mistakes and you do some stupid stuff. And I&#8217;ve been hearing a lot about young people who &#8212; you know, they&#8217;re posting stuff on Facebook, and then suddenly they go apply for a job and somebody has done a search and &#8212; so that&#8217;s some practical political advice for you right there. </em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The president may have been right about this in today&#8217;s world. I hope he&#8217;s wrong in tomorrow&#8217;s. Let&#8217;s unpack what he said to see why.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s absolutely true that young people make mistakes and do stupid things. Anyone who <em>doesn&#8217;t</em> commit youthful stupidities is either inhuman or stunningly boring and inconsequential. Who wants someone like that to be in charge of anything as an adult? Not me.</p>
<p>But it doesn&#8217;t follow, as the president suggested, that posting weird (to older people) things on the Web &#8212; in blogs, social networks and the like &#8212; should be an automatic turnoff or disqualification for a responsible job later on. The notion of punishing someone decades later for what he or she said or did as a teenager or college student just feels wrong to me.</p>
<p>A journalism student where I teach recently asked if it was advisable to have a personal blog or, if so, to be outspoken on it. He&#8217;d apparently been warned that it could put a crimp in his future journalism career plans.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t say how others would react. I do know that if I were hiring someone today I&#8217;d want to know what (not if) he or she posted online, not to find disqualifying factors but to see if this is an interesting person. I&#8217;d take for granted that I might find some things that were risque or inappropriate for my current world. I&#8217;d expect to find things that would be &#8220;unjournalistic&#8221; in some ways, such as outspoken or foolish (or both) views on important people and issues. But I&#8217;d also remember my own ability, if not tendency, to be an idiot when I was that age. And I&#8217;d discount appropriately.</p>
<p>This is all about giving people what my friend Esther Dyson has called a &#8220;statute of limitations on stupidity.&#8221; If we don&#8217;t all start cutting each other more slack in this increasingly transparent (often by our own choice) society, we&#8217;ll only allow drones into positions of authority. Now that&#8217;s really scary.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re making progress, probably more than Obama gives us credit for. Recall that it was impossible for a Catholic to be president, until John F. Kennedy was elected. It was impossible for a divorced person to be elected until Ronald Reagan won. It was impossible for a former pot smoker to be president until Bill Clinton (who bizarrely claimed not to have inhaled) got elected. And so on. </p>
<p>How we make these judgements is neither clear nor simple. Robert McDonnell, a candidate for governor in Virginia, is <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/09/02/AR2009090203444.html?hpid=topnews">taking hits</a> for a 20-year-old master&#8217;s thesis in which he denounced programs that encouraged women to work outside the home and said working women were bad for families. He wants voters to ignore all this and concentrate on what he says are his positions now.</p>
<p>McDonnell deserves some slack, too, but he wrote the thesis when he was in his mid-30s, not his early 20s or younger. His record as a legislator since then has been extremely conservative, as well. What he said two decades ago is obviously more relevant, given the circumstances, than what a student posts on a high-school Facebook page today.</p>
<p>In the foreseeable future, we&#8217;ll elect a president who had blog or Facebook wall or MySpace page when she was a teenager and college student. By the standards of today she&#8217;ll be utterly disqualified for any serious political job. But because we&#8217;ll have grown as a society, not just more tolerant of flaws but understanding that we all have feet of clay in some respect, we&#8217;ll elect her anyway, because we&#8217;ll realize that the person she became &#8212; and how that happened &#8212; is what counts.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p style="clear: both"><a class="image-link" href="http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/president_education_talk-full.png"><img class="linked-to-original" style=" display: inline; float: left; margin: 0 10px 10px 0;" src="http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/president_education_talk-thumb1.png" alt="" width="250" height="174" align="left" /></a>It&#8217;s easy, and appropriate, to feel gloom mixed with contempt at the way some right-wing flamethrowers, abetted by mass media&#8217;s love of conflict, have turned President Obama&#8217;s <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/MediaResources/PreparedSchoolRemarks/">webcast to the nation&#8217;s schoolchildren</a> into a new socialist manifesto. They cherry-picked an innocuous idea from a lesson plan &#8212; the president asking kids to help him do his job better &#8212; and claimed it was radical ideology.</p>
<p style="clear: both">
<p style="clear: both">
<div>So they&#8217;ve persuaded quite a few districts to either not show it or ask parents&#8217; permission. The administrators in those districts have put on a fine demonstration of cowardice. But that is, let&#8217;s be fair, what it takes to run a school system in much of America today, where the worst sin seems to be teaching children how to think for themselves.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the lost opportunity in the Obama talk. Teachers and administrators in the districts that have banned the webcast could have used it in ways that would have put their fear into context. They could have shown it to students and then had a conversation about it.</p></div>
<p style="clear: both">
<p style="clear: both">The Obama critics do have one thing right, though they don&#8217;t seem clear on the concept. They&#8217;re skeptical of what people in authority say. In this case skepticism has morphed into paranoia, as they claim children watching the talk could be indoctrinated by an authority figure who, in their view, is wrong on policy and morality.</p>
<p style="clear: both">Attempting to prevent children from hearing the president&#8217;s words is not just foolish, but counterproductive. I&#8217;m betting this has backfired, given kids&#8217; tendency to seek out what adults tell them to stay away from.</p>
<p style="clear: both">
<p style="clear: both">
<div>Had the fearful administrators chosen to do their jobs, they would have used this speech in at least four ways. They could have shown it and then asked teachers to ask students to to analyze a) what the president had said; b) how he said it; c) how the White House used the media of the day to get his words to the people he wanted to reach; and d) how other media handled the controversy. (They could have done worse than to use the suggested <a href="http://www.ed.gov/teachers/how/lessons/prek-6.pdf">classroom</a> <a href="http://www.ed.gov/teachers/how/lessons/7-12.pdf">activities</a> (PDFs) related to the talk. And I hope that districts where people generally support Obama would also take the opportunity to address these questions.)</div>
<p style="clear: both">
<p style="clear: both">
<div>Buried deep in the Obama address is a single reference to critical thinking, where he refers to &#8220;the insights and critical thinking skills you gain in history and social studies to fight poverty and homelessness, crime and discrimination, and make our nation more fair and more free.&#8221; But are kids really gaining such skills and insights? Not enough, that&#8217;s clear, but sometimes subtlety invades even the most brazen attempts to keep reality away from people.</div>
<p style="clear: both">
<div>The ongoing efforts to to insert religion into science instruction &#8212; essentially insisting that biblical creationism be offered as an &#8220;alternative theory&#8221; to evolution &#8212; are deeply ironic in this context. It&#8217;s one thing to be skeptical, an essential part of critical thinking. It&#8217;s another to turn biology class into Bible study. Yet to the extent that the creationists succeed in this campaign, they are also telling kids to question authority.</div>
<p style="clear: both">
<div>Critical thinking is very much about questioning authority, but not to extremes. It&#8217;s not about disowning the evidence, but rather using it, including information from sources we&#8217;ve come to trust, to make our own decisions. Sometimes we&#8217;ll decide badly. That&#8217;s part of life.</div>
<p style="clear: both">
<div>We&#8217;d decide better if we had better journalism. And this entire mess has featured the too-common substandard variety. Perhaps the people most deserving of contempt in this entire episode are the ones running traditional media organizations that have again abdicated their duty by focusing on the political fighting instead of the serious issues. Even in their coverage of the battles, they&#8217;ve resorted for the most part to the standard stenographic technique of quoting &#8220;both sides&#8221; despite the way one side has been overwhelmingly dishonest.</div>
<p style="clear: both">
<div>David Carr, in his column in yesterday&#8217;s New York Times, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/07/business/media/07carr.html?scp=2&amp;sq=david%20carr&amp;st=cse">took a shot</a> at the problem. He hit the target but missed the bulls-eye. Here&#8217;s an extended quote:</div>
<blockquote style="clear: both"><p><em>The administration seems to believe that if all the information on a given issue is on the table — or in this case, on the Web — then the truth, or at least their version of it, will win out. (The president announced on Friday that with certain exceptions, the names of visitors to the White House would be posted for all to see). For all his modern impulses, President Obama’s press operation seems mired in a high school civics debate version of governance, where points are given for logic and argument.</em></p>
<p><em>That is not how the media works, however, in an environment that prizes engagement and conflict. The long town-hall process over health care, for example, has given ordinary citizens a voice but it has also produced hundreds of video clips of angry, scared Americans. For every aging secretary who can’t afford prescriptions, there is a small business owner who wants less government in their life, not more. Tropes like “death panels” may lack substance, but they make for pretty compelling viewing day after day.</em></p>
<p><em>In part, the outrage and hyperbole work because the mainstream media, insecure about their own status in an atomizing world, play into the tyranny of split-screen coverage where almost any claim — no matter how outlandish — becomes one side in “an interesting debate.” When not listening to talking heads, the traditional news outlets go to great efforts to get a microphone on vox populi. If the people, even if it is some unknown number, are hopping mad, we don’t want to be the last to tell you about it.<br />
</em></p></blockquote>
<p style="clear: both">Bingo. Too bad Carr doesn&#8217;t take his own logic to a logical conclusion. He merely notes &#8220;how the media works&#8221; but doesn&#8217;t even suggest that journalists who cover these issues bear any responsibility for their preference to feed the lie machine instead of counter it. Oh, there have been a few stories pointing out the fundamental unreality on which the protests have been based, but vastly more on the protests themselves.</p>
<p style="clear: both">The most important concept, which Carr misses, is the one the media have abandoned in recent times: responsibility. Look again at the White House graphic at the top of this piece. The president is urging students &#8220;to take responsibility for their educations&#8221; because all the good teaching and parenting won&#8217;t be enough if the students themselves don&#8217;t care.</p>
<p style="clear: both">We share responsibility for knowing what we&#8217;re talking about. The traditional media&#8217;s unwillingness to help &#8212; part of its general collapse &#8212; means that, more and more, it&#8217;s up to the rest of us to figure things out for ourselves.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p style="clear: both"><a href="http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/addthis1-full.png" class="image-link"><img class="linked-to-original" src="http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/addthis1-thumb2.png" height="89" align="left" width="234" style=" display: inline; float: left; margin: 0 10px 10px 0;" /></a><br style="clear: both" />A common belief holds that once something gets onto the Internet, it&#8217;s there indefinitely. This is true, no doubt, for some things. Does anyone believe the Paris Hilton sex video will ever <em>not</em> be out there?</p>
<p style="clear: both">
<div>Not everything does last, however, including some creative works that matter a great deal. Many of the works we should want to keep around disappear all the time, for a variety of reasons.</div>
</p>
<p style="clear: both">
<div>With work that&#8217;s born digital, this need not happen. Blogs and other material are a perfect example of digital material that never be lost &#8212; and it would take a relatively small number of people in the right positions to jump-start this idea.</div>
</p>
<p style="clear: both">
<div>Consider, for instance, the <a href="http://placeblogger.com">&#8220;place blogs&#8221;</a> that have become a valuable part of local lore, sites on which citizens talk about what&#8217;s happening in their own communities. These blogs depend, for the most part, on volunteer efforts. As anyone who works with volunteers knows, however, their ardor for the task tends to flag over time. Bloggers start and stop, and when a blogger gives up his or her work can disappear. Links die along with what they&#8217;ve created.</div>
</p>
<p style="clear: both">
<div>At the <a href="http://loc.gov">Library of Congress</a> this week, where members of a workshop were discussing how to preserve digital news in this networked era, there was little dispute that blogs are serving an expanding role in the news ecosystem. But as an archivist for the state of Wisconsin said, he has enough trouble keeping an archive of community newspapers without having to deal with the place blogs that have sprung up in town after town and city after city.</div>
</p>
<p style="clear: both">
<div>The blogging software I use, <a href="http://wordpress.org">WordPress</a>, has a Tools menu in the administration settings. Among other things, I can import, export and upgrade the blog. When I export, WordPress saves a full archive of the blog &#8212; everything I&#8217;ve created and uploaded online &#8212; into a package that I can move to another WordPress blog or even a site created with competing software.</div>
</p>
<p style="clear: both">
<div>Suppose we could convince the makers of all common blogging software platforms to expand this option, by giving users the ability to easily send what they&#8217;ve been doing, ideally on a regular schedule, to the <a href="http://archive.org">Internet Archive</a>, Library of Congress and/or other repositories willing to save these collected works.</div>
</p>
<p style="clear: both">
<div>The blogger should be able to select from a number of archiving options. For instance, I&#8217;d suggest a setting under which the blogger could tell the archivist that if the blog went &#8220;off the air&#8221; the archivist could restore it to the Web (albeit under a different URL hierarchy in most cases). Another useful element of this auto-save system could be as a way to have a rescue plan after a data loss. An export to the archive should also offer the possibility of an import from it. (Would we need an option to let the user <em>remove</em> the material from the archive if he or she decided it should not remain public? I&#8217;d guess we would, and should.)</div>
</p>
<p style="clear: both">
<div>We could make this happen if a small group of people agreed on some basics. The conversation would need to include blog software companies including WordPress, Movable Type, etc., plus potential storage services including the Internet Archive, the Library of Congress and others. </div>
</p>
<p style="clear: both">Assuming we could make this happen, the next step would be to lobby bloggers, to persuade them that saving their work to public archives would be a good idea. They could know that their work, if they chose, would be around for some time.</p>
<p style="clear: both">
<div>Any site running on a reasonably standard content-management system could be made to work this way, though the more customized the site the harder it may be. And eventually we&#8217;d want to have the big database folks &#8212; talking to you, <a href="http://oracle.com">Oracle</a> (especially now that you&#8217;re going to own <a href="http://mysql.com">MySQL</a>; yike) &#8212; in the conversation. </div>
</p>
<p style="clear: both">
<div>There are other ways to go at this. A workshop group led by Vijay Ravindran, chief technology officer at the <a href="http://washingtonpost.com">Washington Post</a>, came at the overall issue from the &#8220;pull&#8221; side of the ledger &#8212; with an ear toward the demands of the traditional media companies that will cede even a small amount of control over their content about a month after hell freezes over. They suggested a much better system of website notifications (using HTML tags) to notify crawlers that use robots.txt of what&#8217;s available in what ways. This would definitely be an improvement over what we do now, but only a partial solution. We want to preserve the entire hierarchy of the site along with everything that&#8217;s appeared on it, in full.</div>
</p>
<p style="clear: both">Nothing I heard in Washington begins to solve a more interesting problem, which is that so much of what we do (as opposed to view) these days comes from hyper-dynamically generated pages. Look at <a href="http://everyblock.com">Everyblock</a>, for example. How can we archive what the various pages that users create on the fly? (Should we? My belief is that, yes, we should know for posterity, in at least an aggregate sense, what was being created by the people who used the site.) </p>
<p style="clear: both">Right now, the blog idea seems like the low hanging fruit, though. I&#8217;m getting in touch with <a href="http://www.archive.org/about/bios.php">Brewster Kahle</a> at the Internet Archive to see if he&#8217;s interested, along with several of the folks who do the blogging software, and will let you know what they say.</p>
<p style="clear: both">The bottom line for all this is, I hope, obvious. If you are creating things, you should not just own them, but preserve them. This is one way to keep our work alive.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p style="clear: both"><a href="http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/loc2.png" class="image-link"><img class="linked-to-original" src="http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/loc2-thumb.png" height="97" align="left" width="300" style=" display: inline; float: left; margin: 0 10px 10px 0;" /></a>I&#8217;ve been at the <a href="http://loc.gov">Library of Congress</a> for the past two days, in a workshop with a bunch of librarians, news folks and others discussing the long-term preservation of news in a digital era. My role turned out to be pushing for a greater recognition of the non-traditional news sources that are emerging in this networked world, including blogs, social networks and and hyper-dynamically generated material that shows up on screens in large part as a result of what the user wants (and sometimes creates), not solely what the provider thinks is important.</p>
<p style="clear: both">One thing first: I worship librarians. They are under-appreciated in the extreme. What they do enriches us all in a variety of ways. Sitting inside the Jefferson Building at the Library of Congress, in a room that overlooked the U.S. Capitol, I realized that the library is on higher ground than the Capitol itself. Seems reasonable.</p>
<p style="clear: both">The workshop had an understandable tilt toward the creators traditional media&#8217;s dominant life forms in the now-crumbling news ecosystem: newspapers and broadcasters. Saving what they do is unquestionably important. Putting analog content into digital form is a non-trivial issue, and even though the things they produce today are generally created first in digital formats, archiving is not a simple or, at the moment, inexpensive proposition. </p>
<p style="clear: both">As the cost of raw storage plummets, some of the archiving issues will ease, but others will remain. A key issue is the giant stinking pile of garbage known as today&#8217;s copyright system. It deters some uses of news that would be widely beneficial, and is fundamentally a barrier to public understanding, not an enhancement.</p>
<p style="clear: both">Newspapers have treated their own archives &#8212; essential parts of their communities&#8217; history &#8212; with utter disrespect. Some are unavailable, period. Others are on microfilm, with some of those being digitized by private companies that partner with newspapers mostly to create pay-walls that serve almost no one&#8217;s interest.</p>
<p style="clear: both">Digitizing and storing are all but meaningless if the result is (at best in many cases) costly access. Copyright law makes the situation worse, but the attitudes of the people who control the material are probably the bigger problem, especially now that they&#8217;re looking for any port in the fiscal storm that threatens to drown all but the sturdiest in the industry.</p>
<p style="clear: both">It&#8217;s good to see these folks at least acknowledging some of these issues. We don&#8217;t have as much time as we might like to solve them. Our histories &#8212; at least the ones created by traditional media &#8212; are in danger of disappearing, just when we have seen our best opportunity to ensure that they live on, not just as things we keep in vaults but as part of the toolset we all need to understand what&#8217;s been going on and what we can do about it. </p>
<p style="clear: both">One area where we can make a big difference, quickly, is in the part of media we call blogging (but which I define a bit more broadly). We&#8217;ll look at that in the next post.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p style="clear: both">UPDATED</p>
<p style="clear: both">At Time magazine&#8217;s Swampland blog, Joe Klein has <a href="http://swampland.blogs.time.com/2009/08/31/glenn-greenwald/">posted an astonishing attack</a> on Salon&#8217;s Glenn Greenwald. He starts:</p>
<blockquote style="clear: both"><p><em>Twice in the past month, my private communications have been splashed about the internet. That such a thing would happen is unfortunate, and dishonorable, but sadly inevitable, I suppose. I ignored the first case, in which a rather pathetic woman acolyte of Greenwald&#8217;s published a hyperbolic account of a conversation I had with her at a beach picnic on Cape Cod. Now, Greenwald himself has published private emails of mine that were part of a conversation taking place on a list-serve. In one of those emails, I say that Greenwald &#8220;cares not a whit for America&#8217;s national security.&#8221; </em></p></blockquote>
<p style="clear: both">The commenters below Klein&#8217;s rant, and <a href="http://www.salon.com/opinion/greenwald/2009/09/01/klein/">Greenwald himself</a>, do a more than adequate job of refuting the factual misstatements and showing why, in fact, Klein deserves what he&#8217;s been getting in the way of criticism. He&#8217;s a good writer and frequently an astute commentator, but he has committed serious <a href="http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2007/11/time-edits-wire.html">journalistic malpractice</a>, backed by editors who <a href="http://citmedia.org/blog/2007/11/30/on-kleins-errors-time-still-wont-fully-fess-up/">refuse to honorably admit</a> their own gross errors; they&#8217;re part of a Beltway media culture that has so often in recent years disgraced the craft.</p>
<p style="clear: both">The post I&#8217;ve cited above betrays quaint notions of what is private in today&#8217;s world. And it&#8217;s an almost perfect illustration of how not to conduct a conversation in which basic issues are in dispute.</p>
<p style="clear: both">Let&#8217;s begin by examining Klein&#8217;s definition of &#8220;private communications.&#8221; If they were truly private, it would indeed be unfortunate, even dishonorable, if they&#8217;d been exposed. But they weren&#8217;t really private at all.</p>
<p style="clear: both">The most baffling notion in Klein&#8217;s post is that his posts to the &#8220;JournoList,&#8221; a mailing list of at least several hundred influential &#8220;<a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0309/20086.html">journalists, bloggers and policy wonks</a>&#8221; are, or even should be, equivalent to &#8220;private emails.&#8221; This is ludicrous on at least two levels.</p>
<p style="clear: both">First, even a closed mail list is a long way from one-to-one emails, which have the illusion of privacy but, as anyone the least bit familiar with computer security understands, are too easily subject to surveillance. A mail list of 20 people might &#8212; might &#8212; stay with just those people. The JournoList is going to suffer leaks. Period.</p>
<p style="clear: both">I&#8217;m on, and have been a member of, several mail lists. I do not assume for a second that anything I write there is private. In fact, I assume the precise opposite: that anything I say online in even a semi-public forum is likely to make its way to anyone else. You should assume the same thing. Period.</p>
<p style="clear: both">Second, the JList, as the insiders (I&#8217;m not one) call it, testifies to the fundamental seaminess of Washington&#8217;s journalistic culture. Its members &#8212; power players in American political life &#8212; are using it to thrash out what they believe. Policies and journalism may well be influenced by what they discuss there. If the insider-participant journalists weren&#8217;t so compromised by their presence on the list, some of them (one hopes) would be doing their best to expose what&#8217;s being said there. I would nominate for a Pulitzer Prize any journalist who got ahold of JList archives and published, along with the archives themselves, a thorough analysis of how/whether its members&#8217; postings had influenced policy and public understanding.</p>
<p style="clear: both">The question gets murkier when we think about where to draw the line in what&#8217;s private, or should be. If the members of JList debated each other over bar stools, wouldn&#8217;t that be a different issue? Yes, and no, and that gets to the other part of Klein&#8217;s whine.</p>
<p style="clear: both">Klein cites the public recounting of a conversation held in the middle of a Cape Cod party, and this is a much closer call. (Here&#8217;s the <a href="http://nomoremister.blogspot.com/2009/08/no-wait-i-know-this-one-answer-to-who.html">woman&#8217;s post</a> about their conversation; Klein hasn&#8217;t disputed the substance of what she wrote, and he definitely hasn&#8217;t answered the important questions she raised, such as her request that he name names when accusing prominent Democrats of hating America.)</p>
<p style="clear: both">You can make a good argument that party talk &#8212; at most a semi-public venue &#8212; deserves some leeway. I&#8217;m deeply ambivalent about the idea that people would post their recollections of what I&#8217;d said at a party (including the possibility or probability that both people in our the conversation had been drinking, and what that might mean as to the reliability of the recounting; NOTE: THIS IN NO WAY REFERS TO THE CONVERSATION INVOLVING KLEIN ON CAPE COD).</p>
<p style="clear: both">As noted, Klein is a public figure who cultivates a public following. He was holding forth at a party in a public place about his beliefs &#8212; including in this case his vitriol for another person who has gone after him about the work he does for a huge audience. Is he really so naive to the reality of blogging and mobile-phone cameras that he couldn&#8217;t imagine that some element of his ranting wouldn&#8217;t escape from this well-attended party into the public sphere?</p>
<p style="clear: both">Again, not only will such things emerge, but in some cases they should. If a politician or powerful business person started ranting at a party in this way, about matters such a person could influence, (real) journalists would consider that news. Why, then, when powerful journalists are the ones doing the ranting, are their statements unworthy of public attention?</p>
<p style="clear: both">Even public figures, deeply flawed journalists and hypocrites deserve some privacy, however. I don&#8217;t want to see us recording everything we hear in every setting; that would be poison to the kinds of conversations we all need to have, especially the kinds of conversations where we give ourselves the essential freedom to say stupid things that a wise friend or colleague can shoot down. We all say and do stupid things all the time, and a society that made us too cautious would be a deadened one.</p>
<p style="clear: both">Klein&#8217;s distress over the reporting of his outburst at the Cape Cod party is understandable, then, even if it&#8217;s hypocritical and ultimately unworthy of too much sympathy. In the end, we all might be better off he&#8217;d been cut some slack in this particular case. What the blogger reported came as no surprise to anyone who was following Klein&#8217;s work; I just wish she&#8217;d found a way to confront him in a place that everyone would consider entirely public.</p>
<p style="clear: both">UPDATE: Aimai, the blogger in question, <a href="http://mediactive.com/2009/09/01/time-pundit-privacy/comment-page-1/#comment-306">strongly disagrees</a> with me in the comments. She&#8217;s not the only one who thinks I&#8217;m wrong about this.</p>
<p style="clear: both">
<p style="clear: both">***</p>
<p style="clear: both">However mistaken Klein&#8217;s view of privacy may be, he&#8217;s clearly clueless about another element of discourse, online or not.</p>
<p style="clear: both">You can never win a debate &#8212; at least not any debate that I pay attention to &#8212; by resorting to <em>ad hominum</em> insults. If everyone adopted this tenet, we might all be better informed.</p>
<p style="clear: both">Klein&#8217;s reference to what he terms Greenwald&#8217;s &#8220;rather pathetic woman acolyte&#8221; at the Cape Cod party is a tip-off that the facts are probably not on his side. But Klein reserves his most vehement insults for Greenwald, and in the process costs himself credibility.</p>
<p style="clear: both">When you read someone else&#8217;s mind and declare that the other person doesn&#8217;t care about national security, for example, you are engaging in something indefensible. You are implying that the other person is, let&#8217;s put this bluntly, a traitor who welcomes terrorist attacks on our nation. If Klein has evidence of this he should produce it or apologize; do not hold your breath.</p>
<p style="clear: both">And when Klein calls Greenwald a bully, that&#8217;s rich. It&#8217;s Klein who commands the podium at one of America&#8217;s biggest media companies, while Greenwald writes for a well-respected but relatively tiny online publication.</p>
<p style="clear: both">Greenwald is extremely tough on the people he criticizes, but he marshals enormous amounts of evidence for what he writes. He also has an occasional tendency toward shrillness, which I believe (from my own mistakes in this regard in the past) can be a distraction from the facts and conclusions he&#8217;s posting.</p>
<p style="clear: both">But Greenwald has gone way, way out on a journalistic limb &#8212; itself a sad commentary on the state of journalism in recent times &#8212; to champion the Constitution of the United States and the liberties that have helped make us a strong nation. By any standard I can name, preserving liberty is an essential part of national security. Greenwald, in my view, is <em>more</em> patriotic than the people who&#8217;d shred the Bill of Rights to create an illusion of security.</p>
<p style="clear: both">Klein&#8217;s ugly and evidence-thin invective demeans him and what he claims to believe, far more than anything it says about Greenwald. He&#8217;d be wise to use his platform to argue the issues &#8212; if he has arguments that genuinely hold up. In too many cases, he hasn&#8217;t, maybe because he doesn&#8217;t have the best of the debate.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p style="clear: both"><img style=" display: inline; float: right; margin: 0 0 10px 10px;" src="http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/justicescale2-thumb.jpg" alt="" width="103" height="82" align="right" />Here we go again &#8212; a new attack on anonymous speech, misusing the facts ripped from the current headlines about a case of one person&#8217;s slimy online attacks on another. So, as what Maureen Dowd <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/26/opinion/26dowd.html?_r=1">today called</a> the &#8220;Case of the Blond Model and the Malicious Blogger&#8221; gains publicity steam, Dowd and too many other commentators seem to be missing some key points and drawing the wrong lessons.</p>
<p style="clear: both">To refresh your memory, if you haven&#8217;t heard about it, this case involves Liskula Cohen, a model who was on the receiving end of some vile comments next to suggestive pictures, posted under a pseudonym on one of gazillions of such blogs at Google&#8217;s <a href="http://blogger.com">Blogger</a> service. Cohen&#8217;s lawyer persuaded a judge that the posts were arguably defamatory, and the judge <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/18742841/Liskula-Cohen-Opinion">ordered</a> Google to turn over the email address and other logged information it had about the blogger. The company, after first denying Cohen&#8217;s request and saying she&#8217;d need a court order, then complied and handed over the information. The data trail led back to a Cohen acquaintance named Rosemary Port. Cohen, in a demonstration of her own better instincts, said she would forgive Port instead of suing her.</p>
<p style="clear: both">
<p style="clear: both">That&#8217;s where this nasty little incident might have ended. Unfortunately it appears to be heading off in new directions.</p>
<p style="clear: both">
<p style="clear: both">Port says she&#8217;s <a href="http://m.guardian.co.uk/?id=102202&amp;story=http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2009/aug/24/blogging-google">going to sue</a> Google, arguing that she had a right to confidentiality. Give me a break. I&#8217;m a privacy nut, but I believe Google did exactly the right thing in this instance, in part because it obeyed a clear order from a judge who also did the right thing.</p>
<p style="clear: both">
<p style="clear: both">No one can dispute that we have a category of human slime that uses online anonymity (or, usually more accurately, pseudonymity) to attack other people. These people, classic cowards, hide behind the virtual bushes to take potshots, and they do so with the ugliest kind of satisfaction.</p>
<p style="clear: both">
<p style="clear: both">But as Cohen&#8217;s case shows &#8212; the postings about her weren&#8217;t even close to being the worst material I&#8217;ve seen from anonymous sources &#8212;  online media creators aren&#8217;t exempt  from defamation laws, though it may take more effort to find out who they are. The judge in New York, Joan A. Madden, looked at the facts and, in my view, correctly decided that Port&#8217;s blog postings were sufficiently crude to justify Cohen&#8217;s plans to file a defamation lawsuit &#8212; not that they were absolutely defamatory, but that they were within the ballpark that could justify letting a jury decide.</p>
<p style="clear: both">
<p style="clear: both">Port, for her part, told reporters that almost no one would have known about her sleazy behavior had Cohen not gone to court in the first place and had Google not turned her name over. Talk about twisted logic. <em>Cohen</em>, and most likely some of their mutual acquaintances, knew about it. And the likelihood, given the Internet&#8217;s staying power, is that at least some others would have seen Port&#8217;s remarks, too. Let&#8217;s hope the courts toss any lawsuit from Port into the nearest trash can.</p>
<p style="clear: both">
<p style="clear: both">But, as sometimes happens, the larger case is growing, in part due to the large amount of attention it&#8217;s received from media of all varieties &#8212; newspapers, TV, radio and, of course, blogs. It&#8217;s turning into a morality play that could have a real impact on the issue of anonymity. If that impact comes in the form of helping us to establish new norms of behavior, great. If it turns into new laws, watch out.</p>
<p style="clear: both">
<p style="clear: both">One of the norms we&#8217;d be wise to establish is this: People who don’t stand behind their words deserve, in almost every case, no respect for what they say. In many cases, anonymity is a hiding place that harbors cowardice, not honor. The more we can encourage people to use their real names, the better. But if we try to force this, we&#8217;ll create more trouble than we fix.</p>
<p style="clear: both">
<p style="clear: both">People who&#8217;d ban anonymity don&#8217;t seem to realize that it&#8217;s technically impossible unless we&#8217;re willing to turn over all of our communications in every venue to a central authority &#8212; a system that would herald the end of liberty. They can&#8217;t really want such a regime, can they? Meanwhile, even that kind of structure could and would be hacked by motivated types, though with more difficulty.</p>
<p style="clear: both">
<p style="clear: both">Moreover, anonymity has crucially important value. We need it for whistleblowers, for political dissidents in dictatorships &#8212; for those who have important stories to tell but whose lives or livelihoods would be in jeopardy if their identities were exposed.</p>
<p style="clear: both">
<p style="clear: both">In other words, to save the heroes who tell us about vital matters, we have to recognize that we&#8217;ll also have people who use free speech to ignoble ends. When they cross the line to defamation, they deserve the woes they may bring on themselves.</p>
<p style="clear: both">
<p style="clear: both">But we don&#8217;t want, in the end, to turn everything over to the lawyers. The rest of us &#8212; the audience, if you will &#8212; need to establish some new norms as well.</p>
<p style="clear: both">
<p style="clear: both">We are far too prone to accepting what we see and hear. We need to readjust our internal BS meters in a media-saturated age.</p>
<p style="clear: both">
<p style="clear: both">So start with this principle: <em>When you read or hear a</em><em>n anonymous or pseudonymous attack on someone else, you should not just assume &#8212; barring persuasive evidence of the charge &#8212; that it&#8217;s false. Assume that the accuser is an outright, contemptible liar.</em></p>
<p style="clear: both">
<p style="clear: both">This wouldn&#8217;t solve the problem. But it would help.</p>
<p style="clear: both">

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I&#8217;m declaring victory. I&#8217;m moving on, into a new project to help persuade passive consumers of media to become active users.</p>
<p>And, once again, I hope you&#8217;ll help.</p>
<p>A few years ago I wrote a book called <a href="http://wethemedia.oreilly.com"><em>We the Media: Grassroots Journalism by the People, for the People</em></a>, suggesting that we were on the verge of an evolutionary leap. Amid the democratization of media tools and access, I said, the lecture mode of journalism was giving way to conversation; and that stemmed, in part, from the simple fact that the audience always knows more than the person telling the story.</p>
<p><img src="http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/churchillvictory1-thumb.jpg" alt="" width="141" height="194" align="left" />This evolutionary shift is still in its relatively early days. We are in a period of immense disruption, especially notable in the demolition of the business model that has paid for most traditional journalism for the past half-century or so.</p>
<p>Like everyone else, journalists have always been publicly preoccupied with their own situation. Unlike almost everyone else, they&#8217;ve owned a higher podium and a louder megaphone.</p>
<p>So we&#8217;ve been bombarded with angst, recriminations and, lately, panic emanating from an industry in jeopardy &#8212; a business that can no longer rely on the monopoly and oligopoly profits that spun off some occasionally brilliant journalism during the industry&#8217;s fattest era.</p>
<p>But look around. The messy process of reinvention is well under way.</p>
<p>Not a week goes by without a new announcement of an experiment in journalism. <a href="http://www.jiltedjournalists.com/News.html">Today&#8217;s news</a> regards a project, featuring finance writer Jane Bryant Quinn and her husband, aimed at helping local news reporting find a business model. Good luck to them &#8212; and the thousands of other folks who are working on these problems.</p>
<p>Last week&#8217;s news was from an Aspen Institute conference where a high-powered group of folks publicly agonized about the future of journalism. From a distance, the highlight looked to me to be the <a href="http://newsinnovation.com/">New Business Models for News</a> project from Jeff Jarvis and company at City University of New York.</p>
<p>More recently it was <a href="http://growthspur.com">GrowthSpur</a>, a consultancy created by digital media pioneer Mark Potts and some colleagues, and aiming to &#8220;provide tools, training, services and ad networks that will help local sites grow and become successful businesses.&#8221;</p>
<p>And <a href="http://trueslant.com/" target="_top">True/Slant</a>; <a href="http://huffingtonpost.com" target="_top">Huffington Post</a>; <a href="http://www.journalismonline.com/" target="_top">Journalism Online LLC</a>; <a href="http://spot.us">Spot.US</a>; <a href="http://everyblock.com">EveryBlock</a> (<a href="http://dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/08/17/msnbccom-to-buy-hyperlocal-site-everyblock/">sold</a> to MSNBC); and countless others (including our <a href="http://cronkite.asu.edu/node/673">terrific media-entrepreneurship students</a> at <a href="http://cronkite.asu.edu">Arizona State University</a>) who are proving out Clay Shirky&#8217;s <a href="http://www.shirky.com/weblog/2009/03/newspapers-and-thinking-the-unthinkable/">observation</a>: &#8220;Nothing will work, but everything might. Now&#8217;s the time for lots and lots of experiments.&#8221;</p>
<p>So I&#8217;m declaring victory, albeit early, on the supply side of the equation. Democratized media are giving voice to everyone who has something to add to the emergent global conversation, and the same tools are enabling smart people to experiment with sustainability models for tomorrow&#8217;s news and information. We will have plenty of quality news and information &#8212; though sorting the good stuff from the sludge will be just one of the huge issues we&#8217;ll have to deal with as we move forward into this new era. And, of course, we&#8217;ll need to help people creating that supply do a better job at all levels.</p>
<p>But that doesn&#8217;t solve what may be a bigger issue: crappy demand.</p>
<p>We have raised several generations of passive consumers of news and information. That&#8217;s not good enough anymore.</p>
<p>The media of today and tomorrow require us to become active users<em>.</em> And that&#8217;s a prime focus of this new project, <em>Mediactive</em>, the title of this website and an upcoming book. (Here&#8217;s the early <a href="http://mediactive.com/book/outline/">chapter outline</a>.)</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">My publisher, as with <em>We the Media,</em> is <a href="http://oreilly.com">O&#8217;Reilly Media</a>, the only company of its kind that truly gets this stuff. We&#8217;re going to be experimenting, in part, with the very nature of what a book is in a Digital Age.<br />
</span></p>
<p>Indeed, this entire project is about experimentation. Some of what we try will not work. Some of it will. But in the end, I hope to have created a solid user&#8217;s guide to news and information, for people who realize that they have to take some responsibility for knowing what they&#8217;re talking about.</p>
<p>Being active users of media is not an &#8220;eat your spinach because it&#8217;s good for you&#8221; exercise. It&#8217;s definitely good for us, but it&#8217;s also interesting and/or fun &#8212; and in the end truly satisfying.</p>
<p>As with <em>We the Media,</em> I&#8217;m not working in a vacuum. Lots of other people are thinking about these questions and trying to come up with answers, too. As always, we&#8217;re in this together.</p>
