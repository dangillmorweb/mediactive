	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I talk a lot about ecosystems in my work. Here&#8217;s why I think the word is so important for the future of journalism.</p>
<p>Humanity has learned that diverse ecosystems are more stable than ones that are less diverse. The dangers of monocultures are well understood despite our reliance on them in, among many other things, modern farming and finance. When society relies on a monoculture that fails, the results are catastrophic.</p>
<p>A diverse ecosystem features ongoing failure and success. Entire species come and go, but the impact of losing a single species in a trulty diverse ecosystem &#8212; however unfortunte for that species &#8212; is limited. In a diverse and vibrant capitalist economy, the failure of enterprises is tragic only for the specific constituencies of those enterprises, but what Schumpeter called “creative destruction,” assuming that we have fair and enforceable rules of the road for all, ensures the long-term sustainability of the economy.</p>
<p>The journalistic ecosystem of past half-century, like the overall media ecosystem, was dominated by a small number of giant companies. Those enterprises, aided by governmental policies and manufacturing-era efficiencies of scale, controlled the marketplace, and grew bigger and bigger.  The collision of Internet-fueled technology and traditional media’s advertising model was cataclysmic for the big companies that dominated.</p>
<p>But is it catastrophic for the communities and society they served? In the short term, it’s plainly problematic, at least when we consider Big Journalism’s role as a watchdog, though the dominant companies have served in that role inconsistently, at best, especially in recent years. But the worriers appear to assume that we can’t replace what we will lose. They have no faith in the restorative power of a diverse ecosystem, because they don’t know what it’s like to be part of one.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>More than 10 weeks since it published an editorial <a href="../2009/10/24/washington-post-editorial-remains-uncorrected/">based on a false premise</a>, the Washington Post has neither acknowledged nor corrected its mistake.</p>
<p>Then again, the same editorial page routinely publishes op-ed columns that are not truthful. Maybe we shouldn&#8217;t be surprised when the people who write the unsigned editorials do the same.</p>
<p>In any event, the Post&#8217;s refusal to even address this error &#8212; I&#8217;ve expressed my disgust to the newspaper&#8217;s ombudsman, who says the editorial page is off limits for his reviews &#8212; is disgraceful.</p>

<p>Like many other people, I have a Facebook account. One reason is to keep track of what&#8217;s happening in the planet&#8217;s largest social network, including what application developers and users are doing there.</p>
<p>Another is that some of my friends &#8212; actual friends &#8212; are using the site. Facebook helps me stay in touch.</p>
<p>But the <a href="http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2009/12/facebooks-new-privacy-changes-good-bad-and-ugly">privacy fiasco</a> of the past few days has left me feeling that I really can&#8217;t entirely trust Facebook, even with the limited amount of things I&#8217;ve said and done on the site since I got an account several years ago. Maybe I&#8217;m over-reacting &#8212; and I continue to admire the company&#8217;s accomplishments in many other ways &#8212; but that&#8217;s just the way it is.</p>
<p>Why don&#8217;t I feel safe and sound in their benevolent hands? Because although some of the changes they&#8217;ve made in their privacy settings are actually helpful, they are suggesting that users share much more of their data and other information, much more widely than ever. Facebook&#8217;s extremely smart leaders know perfectly well that the majority of users are likely to accept these suggestions, because most people say yes to whatever the default settings are in any application.</p>
<p>I wasn&#8217;t very happy with my Facebook situation in any case. Early on, I said yes to just about everyone who asked me to &#8220;friend&#8221; them, including people barely knew and some I didn&#8217;t know at all.</p>
<p>The privacy changes &#8212; and my continuing uncertainty, given the number of pages you have to look at to modify your settings &#8212; made me realize I&#8217;d rather take fewer chances. So I&#8217;ve made a fairly drastic change.</p>
<p>This morning, I deleted my account. Then I started a new one.</p>
<p>Actually, I scheduled the old one for deletion several weeks from now, which is all Facebook allows. The company figures, perhaps correctly, that some people will have made this decision rashly and wants to give them a way to reconsider. And it&#8217;s clearly in Facebook&#8217;s interest to avoid as many cancellations as possible for business reasons.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t easy to figure out how to delete the account, which no doubt is part of the company&#8217;s strategy, too. If you go to your Settings page, the only option in this realm is to &#8220;deactivate,&#8221; not delete.</p>
<p>But a little searching on the site turns up this Facebook Group called <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=16929680703">&#8220;How to permanently delete your facebok account&#8221;</a> (more than 35,000 members) &#8212; which in turn reveals <a href="http://www.facebook.com/help/contact.php?show_form=delete_account">this link</a> to a delete-account form.</p>
<p>Before I did the actual deletion, however, I went to my Account Settings and opened up the Username option. I&#8217;d previously set my username to &#8220;dangillmor&#8221; so my Facebook URL would be facebook.com/dangillmor, and wanted to be able to use that again. I changed the username to something else, and only then did I delete the account.</p>
<p>Then I started a new account, using a different email address, and set the username to match the old one.</p>
<p>Next up was a check of the default privacy settings for new users. They&#8217;re pretty <em>un-private</em>, in my view, sharing way too much with people you don&#8217;t know. I systematically went through the various screens &#8212; Facebook makes this chore both annoying and obscure, perhaps on purpose &#8212; to ratchet down the settings to something I can live with.</p>
<p>Look, we all know what is Facebook&#8217;s best interest: exposing to search engines and advertisers the largest possible number of pages by among the largest number of people willing to create stuff and make it all public. Marketers drool at what they can do at Facebook if the company will only let them, and Facebook&#8217;s entirely rational goal, like almost every other Internet company&#8217;s, is to make profits in almost any way it can. What&#8217;s in the corporate interest, however, doesn&#8217;t necessarily match what&#8217;s in my interest, or yours.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;m still at facebook.com/dangillmor &#8212; though my <em>real</em> Web homebase is <a href="http://dangillmor.com">dangillmor.com</a> &#8212; with just two Facebook friends at the moment. I&#8217;ll be adding more, but not in any hasty way.</p>

		<p>More than nine weeks since it published an editorial <a href="../2009/10/24/washington-post-editorial-remains-uncorrected/">based on a false premise</a>, the Washington Post has neither acknowledged nor corrected its mistake.</p>
<p>Then again, the same editorial page routinely publishes op-ed columns that are not truthful. Maybe we shouldn&#8217;t be surprised when the people who write the editorials do the same.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>UPDATED</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s Washington Post editorial pages feature an &#8220;op-ed&#8221; column entitled <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/12/08/AR2009120803402.html?hpid=opinionsbox1">Sarah Palin on the politicization of the Copenhagen climate conference</a>. Never mind that the column is <a href="http://politics.theatlantic.com/2009/12/palins_boycott_copenhagen_op-ed_annotated.php">full of falsehoods</a>; the Post and most other papers often run letters, op-ed columns and editorials that contain falsehoods. (Sometimes they correct the errors; often <a href="http://mediactive.com/2009/12/07/nearly-2-months-since-major-washington-post-error-no-correction/">they</a> <a href="http://mediactive.com/2009/11/24/that-hallowed-standard-of-accuracy-oops/">don&#8217;t</a>.)</p>
<p>My issue here is with the column&#8217;s tagline:<br />
<em><br />
<blockquote>The writer was the 2008 Republican nominee for vice president and governor of Alaska from 2006 to 2009.</p></blockquote>
<p></em><br />
Does anyone who understands media and PR really buy this &#8212; the notion that Palin wrote the column in question? Of course not.</p>
<p>Op-ed pieces that run under the bylines of famous politicians, celebrities and business people are almost never written by those people, just as they rarely write their autobiographies, even first drafts, by themselves. They don&#8217;t have time. Their staffers and PR people research and write the pieces.</p>
<p>Society has a serious blind spot about this kind of thing &#8212; and applies a pernicious double standard. If we catch a student paying someone to write his or her paper for a class, we give the student an F. Or, in some cases (like a journalism school), we might even ask the student to leave.</p>
<p>So why do newspaper editors think it&#8217;s fine to wink at obvious deception? They could put a stop to the fiction tomorrow, but probably won&#8217;t. The continuing lure of &#8220;free content,&#8221; especially with famous names at the top, is an ingrained habit, however wrong.</p>
<p>Ghost-written op-eds are often compared with speechwriter-written speeches. Since we all know that most famous people don&#8217;t write their own lines for speeches, goes this logic, we should assume the same with a byline &#8212; whether on a book or an op-ed.</p>
<p>Call me naive, but I&#8217;d like to hold journalists to a slightly higher standard. Newspapers have given away enough of their credibility in recent times. Maybe this is a place to regain a little.</p>
<p>UPDATE: A Twitter commenter asked, essentially, what&#8217;s the harm if everyone knows it&#8217;s happening. First, not everyone does know. Sure, media-savvy people are well aware of the fakery. I&#8217;m not certain that <em>everyone</em> takes for granted that these are ghost-written, however.</p>
<p>Again, the point is not that celebrity politicians are going to stop doing this. It&#8217;s that newspapers, which should care about little things like credibility, should stop being complicit in the deception. Even if it turns out to be true that everyone knows, it&#8217;s still wrong.</p>

<p>Users of the iPhone in the U.S. have been plaugued by AT&amp;T&#8217;s lousy network, but now the telecom company is crowdsourcing what it hopes will help identify the worst parts of the network. It can&#8217;t tell if your call has been dropped on purpose &#8212; that is, you hung up &#8212; or whether it dropped because of the crappy network. So it&#8217;s <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2009/12/iphone-app-reports-dropped-calls-poor-voice-quality-to-att/">asking users</a> for help, according to Wired News.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a media point to this. AT&amp;T understands the value of its customers&#8217; collective knowledge. Journalists are still missing it, for the most part.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>UPDATED</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/06/business/media/06animate.html?hp"><img style="margin-top: 2px; margin-bottom: 2px; margin-left: 4px; margin-right: 4px; border: 0px initial initial;" src="http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/animation-woods1.png" border="0" alt="animation woods.png" width="238" height="145" align="right" /></a>On the front page of Sunday&#8217;s print edition and home page of the online edition, the New York Times is clucking about an animation it puts in the category of &#8220;Maybe Journalism.&#8221; The widely seen video, from a Hong Kong media company, purports to show what transpired between Tiger Woods and his wife in the recent incident that has dominated our celebrity-addled news programming lately.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the top of the Times&#8217; story, entitled <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/06/business/media/06animate.html?hp">&#8220;In Animated Videos, News and Guesswork Mix&#8221;</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Welcome to the new world of Maybe Journalism — a best guess at the news as it might well have been, rendered as a video game and built on a bed of pure surmise. </em></p>
<p><em>A computer-generated ‘news report’ of the Tiger Woods S.U.V. crash — complete with a robotic-looking simulation of Mr. Woods’s wife chasing him with a golf club — has become a top global online video of the moment, perhaps offering a glimpse at the future of journalism, tabloid division. (No matter that the police said she was using the club to release Mr. Woods from the car.)</em></p>
<p><em> </em><em>The minute-and-a-half-long digitally animated piece was created by Next Media, a Hong Kong-based company with gossipy newspapers in Hong Kong and Taiwan. The video is one of more than 20 the company releases a day, often depicting events that no journalist actually witnessed — and that may not have even occurred. </em></p></blockquote>
<p>A glimpse at journalism&#8217;s future, tabloid division? How about journalism&#8217;s present, in a somewhat different form?</p>
<p>It looks more to me like the latter. Next Media is following in the footsteps of what American journalism has made a trademark, particularly in the book, magazine and tabloid-TV businesses. Modern books about politics and business, in particular, are loaded with direct quotes and minute details of events &#8220;no journalist actually witnessed.&#8221;</p>
<p>These techniques have a purpose. They&#8217;re designed at least as much to capture and hold the attention of print and video audiences as to enlighten them.</p>
<p>I acknowledge that this is a bit of a stretch. I&#8217;m emphatically not saying that fly-on-the-wall print accounts, which journalists claim are based on extensive interviews with principals, are close to the same thing as this maybe-it-happened video.</p>
<p>I am saying that when people ask you to trust their depictions of &#8220;events that no journalist actually witnessed &#8212; and that may not have even occurred,&#8221; you take them with a serious grain of salt.</p>
<p>Some of this stuff has been going on for decades. In 1965 Truman Capote called his masterwork &#8212; <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Cold_Blood">In Cold Blood</a></em>, about the killing of a Kansas family and the killers&#8217; path to their executions &#8212; a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/books/97/12/28/home/capote-interview.html">&#8220;nonfiction novel&#8221;</a>. He helped create a new form of literature. He also helped spark the form of journalism that has become so standard now: the fly-on-the-wall pretense that pervades so much of what we see.</p>
<p>Critics later questioned Capote&#8217;s motives and methods, and ultimately the basic honesty of the book. But he was honest at least in the sense that he acknowledged that he was writing a novel, and more rigorous as a reporter than a lot of modern journalists even pretend to be. (Norman Mailer also called his brilliant book about a real crime, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/books/97/05/04/reviews/mailer-song.html">The Executioner&#8217;s Song</a>, a novel.)</p>
<p>The Washington Post&#8217;s Bob Woodward is the most famous current practitioner of the nonfiction novel, though he&#8217;d undoubtedly insist that his work is pure journalism. I don&#8217;t trust a thing he writes, and haven&#8217;t for some time.</p>
<p>Woodward&#8217;s books are loaded with direct quotations of people he says he interviewed, and some he didn&#8217;t. How can you have faith, beyond assuming that he&#8217;s telling the truth  when he says he has it right, that it <em>is</em> right? Why should you?</p>
<p>Now everybody, or seemingly everybody, follows the Woodward lead. Novelistic journalism is the order of our times. But I&#8217;m convinced it&#8217;s one the reasons people have concluded, rationally, that they can&#8217;t really believe anything anymore.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/imagepages/2009/12/06/world/06reconstruct-graphic.html"><img style="margin-top: 2px; margin-bottom: 2px; margin-left: 4px; margin-right: 4px; border: 0px initial initial;" src="http://mediactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/situation-room-obama.png" border="0" alt="situation room obama.png" width="191" height="147" align="left" /></a>Newspapers, too, play the fly-on-the-wall game. Consider what the Times itself did today.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Maybe Journalism&#8221; piece runs at the bottom of the front page, while at the top is <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/06/world/asia/06reconstruct.html?hp=&amp;pagewanted=all">a long story</a> about how President Obama, after long consultations with advisors, reached his decision to escalate the war in Afghanistan. The story is based, says the reporter, on &#8220;dozens of interviews with participants as well as a review of notes some of them took during Mr. Obama’s 10 meetings with his national security team. Most of those interviewed spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, but their accounts have been matched against those of other participants wherever possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>We readers are still being asked to trust the word of people who violated the confidentiality of the White House Situation Room and other internal deliberations. I tend to believe the overall thrust of the story &#8212; that Obama and his team struggled mightily with this decision &#8212; but I don&#8217;t have any faith in most of the particulars, including the anonymously sourced direct quotes of the president and others in the deliberations.</p>
<p>Why is this not, in the words of the story about the Hong Kong animators, &#8220;depicting events that no journalist actually witnessed — and that may not have even occurred&#8221;?</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t the first draft of history. It&#8217;s the first draft of someone&#8217;s nonfiction novel on the Obama presidency.</p>
<p><em>(<a href="http://dangillmor.com/about">Disclosure</a>: I own a small number of shares in the New York Times Co. They&#8217;re worth a lot less than I paid for them. Updated to make clearer that I&#8217;m not equating in any apples-to-apples way the animations and the fly on wall journalism.)</em></p>
